| **[On the Complexity of Knapsack under Explorable Uncertainty: Hardness and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02657v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the knapsack problem under explorable uncertainty, we are given a knapsack instance with uncertain item profits. Instead of having access to the precise profits, we are only given uncertainty intervals that are guaranteed to contain the corresponding profits. The actual item profit can be obtained via a query. The goal of the problem is to adaptively query item profits until the revealed information suffices to compute an optimal (or approximate) solution to the underlying knapsack instance. Since queries are costly, the objective is to minimize the number of queries. In the offline variant of this problem, we assume knowledge of the precise profits and the task is to compute a query set of minimum cardinality that a third party without access to the profits could use to identify an optimal (or approximate) knapsack solution. We show that this offline variant is complete for the second-level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $\Sigma_2^p$-complete, and cannot be approximated within a non-trivial factor unless $\Sigma_2^p = \Delta_2^p$. Motivated by these strong hardness results, we consider a resource-augmented variant of the problem where the requirements on the query set computed by an algorithm are less strict than the requirements on the optimal solution we compare against. More precisely, a query set computed by the algorithm must reveal sufficient information to identify an approximate knapsack solution, while the optimal query set we compare against has to reveal sufficient information to identify an optimal solution. We show that this resource-augmented setting allows interesting non-trivial algorithmic results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dominating Set Knapsack: Profit Optimization on Dominating Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24032v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a large-scale network, we want to choose some influential nodes to make a profit by paying some cost within a limited budget so that we do not have to spend more budget on some nodes adjacent to the chosen nodes; our problem is the graph-theoretic representation of it. We define our problem Dominating Set Knapsack by attaching Knapsack Problem with Dominating Set on graphs. Each vertex is associated with a cost factor and a profit amount. We aim to choose some vertices within a fixed budget that gives maximum profit so that we do not need to choose their 1-hop neighbors. We show that the Dominating Set Knapsack problem is strongly NP-complete even when restricted to Bipartite graphs but weakly NP-complete for Star graphs. We present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for Trees in time $O(n\cdot min\{s^2, (\alpha(V))^2\})$. We show that Dominating Set Knapsack is very unlikely to be Fixed Parameter Tractable(FPT) by proving that it is in W[2]-hard parameterized by the solution size. We developed FPT algorithms with running time $O(4^{tw}\cdot n^{O(1)} \cdot min\{s^2,{\alpha(V)}^2\})$ and $O(2^{vck-1}\cdot n^{O(1)} \cdot min\{s^2,{\alpha(V)}^2\})$, where $tw$ represents the treewidth of the given graph, $vck$ is the solution size of the Vertex Cover Knapsack, $s$ is the size of the knapsack and $\alpha(V)=\sum_{v\in V}\alpha(v)$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unbounded knapsack problem and double partitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23499v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unbounded knapsack problem can be considered as a particular case of the double partition problem that asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of two linear Diophantine equations with integer coefficients. In the middle of 19th century Sylvester and Cayley suggested an approach based on the variable elimination allowing a reduction of a double partition to a sum of scalar partitions. This manuscript discusses a geometric interpretation of this method and its application to the knapsack problem.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Knapsack Optimization-based Schema Linking for LLM-based Text-to-SQL Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12911v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating SQLs from user queries is a long-standing challenge, where the accuracy of initial schema linking significantly impacts subsequent SQL generation performance. However, current schema linking models still struggle with missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial reason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to capture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking performance. Motivated by this, we propose enhanced schema linking metrics by introducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack optimization-based Schema Linking Approach (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking method designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while minimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical linking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and subsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking candidate space. In each linking process, it utilizes a knapsack optimization approach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited tolerance of potentially redundant ones. With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B achieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs, including deepseek-v3 with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method. Extensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can significantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA Text2SQL models by substituting their schema linking processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Efficient Knapsack Optimization Using Probabilistic Memristor Crossbars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04332v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained optimization underlies crucial societal problems (for instance, stock trading and bandwidth allocation), but is often computationally hard (complexity grows exponentially with problem size). The big-data era urgently demands low-latency and low-energy optimization at the edge, which cannot be handled by digital processors due to their non-parallel von Neumann architecture. Recent efforts using massively parallel hardware (such as memristor crossbars and quantum processors) employing annealing algorithms, while promising, have handled relatively easy and stable problems with sparse or binary representations (such as the max-cut or traveling salesman problems).However, most real-world applications embody three features, which are encoded in the knapsack problem, and cannot be handled by annealing algorithms - dense and non-binary representations, with destabilizing self-feedback. Here we demonstrate a post-digital-hardware-friendly randomized competitive Ising-inspired (RaCI) algorithm performing knapsack optimization, experimentally implemented on a foundry-manufactured CMOS-integrated probabilistic analog memristor crossbar. Our solution outperforms digital and quantum approaches by over 4 orders of magnitude in energy efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Knapsack and Shortest Path Problems Generalizations From A Quantum-Inspired Tensor Network Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11711v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present two tensor network quantum-inspired algorithms to solve the knapsack and the shortest path problems, and enables to solve some of its variations. These methods provide an exact equation which returns the optimal solution of the problems. As in other tensor network algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, the method is based on imaginary time evolution and the implementation of restrictions in the tensor network. In addition, we introduce the use of symmetries and the reutilization of intermediate calculations, reducing the computational complexity for both problems. To show the efficiency of our implementations, we carry out some performance experiments and compare the results with those obtained by other classical algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, extended version of the presented and published at the 1st International Conference on Quantum Software (IQSOFT)</p></details> |
| **[An extension of Dembo-Hammer's reduction algorithm for the 0-1 knapsack problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06138v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dembo-Hammer's Reduction Algorithm (DHR) is one of the classical algorithms for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem (0-1 KP) and its variants, which reduces an instance of the 0-1 KP to a sub-instance of smaller size with reduction time complexity $O(n)$. We present an extension of DHR (abbreviated as EDHR), which reduces an instance of 0-1 KP to at most $n^i$ sub-instances for any positive integer $i$. In practice, $i$ can be set as needed. In particular, if we choose $i=1$ then EDHR is exactly DHR. Finally, computational experiments on randomly generated data instances demonstrate that EDHR substantially reduces the search tree size compared to CPLEX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Submodular Maximization over a Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12126v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider fairness in submodular maximization subject to a knapsack constraint, a fundamental problem with various applications in economics, machine learning, and data mining. In the model, we are given a set of ground elements, each associated with a weight and a color, and a monotone submodular function defined over them. The goal is to maximize the submodular function while guaranteeing that the total weight does not exceed a specified budget (the knapsack constraint) and that the number of elements selected for each color falls within a designated range (the fairness constraint). While there exists some recent literature on this topic, the existence of a non-trivial approximation for the problem -- without relaxing either the knapsack or fairness constraints -- remains a challenging open question. This paper makes progress in this direction. We demonstrate that when the number of colors is constant, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a constant approximation with high probability. Additionally, we show that if either the knapsack or fairness constraint is relaxed only to require expected satisfaction, a tight approximation ratio of $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$ can be obtained in expectation for any $\epsilon >0$.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online Knapsack Problems with Estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21750v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine you are a computer scientist who enjoys attending conferences or workshops within the year. Sadly, your travel budget is limited, so you must select a subset of events you can travel to. When you are aware of all possible events and their costs at the beginning of the year, you can select the subset of the possible events that maximizes your happiness and is within your budget. On the other hand, if you are blind about the options, you will likely have a hard time when trying to decide if you want to register somewhere or not, and will likely regret decisions you made in the future. These scenarios can be modeled by knapsack variants, either by an offline or an online problem. However, both scenarios are somewhat unrealistic: Usually, you will not know the exact costs of each workshop at the beginning of the year. The online version, however, is too pessimistic, as you might already know which options there are and how much they cost roughly. At some point, you have to decide whether to register for some workshop, but then you are aware of the conference fee and the flight and hotel prices. We model this problem within the setting of online knapsack problems with estimates: in the beginning, you receive a list of potential items with their estimated size as well as the accuracy of the estimates. Then, the items are revealed one by one in an online fashion with their actual size, and you need to decide whether to take one or not. In this article, we show a best-possible algorithm for each estimate accuracy $\delta$ (i.e., when each actual item size can deviate by $\pm \delta$ from the announced size) for both the simple knapsack and the simple knapsack with removability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Online General Knapsack with Reservation Costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20855v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the online general knapsack problem, an algorithm is presented with an item $x=(s,v)$ of size $s$ and value $v$ and must irrevocably choose to pack such an item into the knapsack or reject it before the next item appears. The goal is to maximize the total value of the packed items without overflowing the knapsack's capacity. As this classical setting is way too harsh for many real-life applications, we will analyze the online general knapsack problem under the reservation model. Here, instead of accepting or rejecting an item immediately, an algorithm can delay the decision of whether to pack the item by paying a fraction $0\le \alpha$ of the size or the value of the item. This models many practical applications, where, for example, decisions can be delayed for some costs e.g. cancellation fees. We present results for both variants: First, for costs depending on the size of the items and then for costs depending on the value of the items. If the reservation costs depend on the size of the items, we find a matching upper and lower bound of $2$ for every $\alpha$. On the other hand, if the reservation costs depend on the value of the items, we find that no algorithm is competitive for reservation costs larger than $1/2$ of the item value, and we find upper and lower bounds for the rest of the reservation range $0\le\alpha< 1/2$.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Knapsack on Graphs with Relaxed Neighborhood Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17297v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the knapsack problems with neighborhood constraints that were studied before, the input is a graph $\mathcal{G}$ on a set $\mathcal{V}$ of items, each item $v \in \mathcal{V}$ has a weight $w_v$ and profit $p_v$, the size $s$ of the knapsack, and the demand $d$. The goal is to compute if there exists a feasible solution whose total weight is at most $s$ and total profit is at most $d$. Here, feasible solutions are all subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of the items such that, for every item in $\mathcal{S}$, at least one of its neighbors in $\mathcal{G}$ is also in $\mathcal{S}$ for \hor, and all its neighbors in $\mathcal{G}$ are also in $\mathcal{S}$ for \hand~\cite{borradaile2012knapsack}. We study a relaxation of the above problems. Specifically, we allow all possible subsets of items to be feasible solutions. However, only those items for which we pick at least one or all of its neighbor (out-neighbor for directed graph) contribute to profit whereas every item picked contribute to the weight; we call the corresponding problems \sor and \sand. We show that both \sor and \sand are strongly \NPC even on undirected graphs. Regarding parameterized complexity, we show both \sor and \hor are \WTH parameterized by the size $s$ of the knapsack size. Interestingly, both \sand and \hand are \WOH parameterized by knapsack size, $s$ plus profit demand, $d$ and also parameterized by solution size, $b$. For \sor and \hor, we present a randomized color-coding-based pseudo-\FPT algorithm, parameterized by the solution size $b$, and consequently by the demand $d$. We then consider the treewidth of the input graph as our parameter and design pseudo fixed-parameter tractable (\FPT) algorithm parameterized by treewidth, $\text{tw}$ for all variants. Finally, we present an additive $1$ approximation for \sor when both the weight and profit of every vertex is $1$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Knapsack for Sequential Competitive Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16752v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses competitive resource allocation in a sequential setting, where two players allocate resources across objects or locations of shared interest. Departing from the simultaneous Colonel Blotto game, our framework introduces a sequential decision-making dynamic, where players act with partial or complete knowledge of previous moves. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on complex mixed strategies, we focus on deterministic pure strategies, streamlining computation while preserving strategic depth. Additionally, we extend the payoff structure to accommodate fractional allocations and payoffs, moving beyond the binary, all-or-nothing paradigm to allow more granular outcomes. We model this problem as an adversarial knapsack game, formulating it as a bilevel optimization problem that integrates the leader's objective with the follower's best-response. This knapsack-based approach is novel in the context of competitive resource allocation, with prior work only partially leveraging it for follower analysis. Our contributions include: (1) proposing an adversarial knapsack formulation for the sequential resource allocation problem, (2) developing efficient heuristics for fractional allocation scenarios, and (3) analyzing the 0-1 knapsack case, providing a computational hardness result alongside a heuristic solution.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Weakly Approximating Knapsack in Subquadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15001v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the classic Knapsack problem. Let $t$ and $\mathrm{OPT}$ be the capacity and the optimal value, respectively. If one seeks a solution with total profit at least $\mathrm{OPT}/(1 + \varepsilon)$ and total weight at most $t$, then Knapsack can be solved in $\tilde{O}(n + (\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^2)$ time [Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang '24][Mao '24]. This running time is the best possible (up to a logarithmic factor), assuming that $(\min,+)$-convolution cannot be solved in truly subquadratic time [K\"unnemann, Paturi, and Schneider '17][Cygan, Mucha, W\k{e}grzycki, and W{\l}odarczyk '19]. The same upper and lower bounds hold if one seeks a solution with total profit at least $\mathrm{OPT}$ and total weight at most $(1 + \varepsilon)t$. Therefore, it is natural to ask the following question. If one seeks a solution with total profit at least $\mathrm{OPT}/(1+\varepsilon)$ and total weight at most $(1 + \varepsilon)t$, can Knsapck be solved in $\tilde{O}(n + (\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{2-\delta})$ time for some constant $\delta > 0$? We answer this open question affirmatively by proposing an $\tilde{O}(n + (\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{7/4})$-time algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICALP2025</p></details> |
| **[The Competitive Ratio of Threshold Policies for Online Unit-density Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08735v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a wholesale supply chain ordering problem. In this problem, the supplier has an initial stock, and faces an unpredictable stream of incoming orders, making real-time decisions on whether to accept or reject each order. What makes this wholesale supply chain ordering problem special is its ``knapsack constraint,'' that is, we do not allow partially accepting an order or splitting an order. The objective is to maximize the utilized stock. We model this wholesale supply chain ordering problem as an online unit-density knapsack problem. We study randomized threshold algorithms that accept an item as long as its size exceeds the threshold. We derive two optimal threshold distributions, the first is 0.4324-competitive relative to the optimal offline integral packing, and the second is 0.4285-competitive relative to the optimal offline fractional packing. Both results require optimizing the cumulative distribution function of the random threshold, which are challenging infinite-dimensional optimization problems. We also consider the generalization to multiple knapsacks, where an arriving item has a different size in each knapsack. We derive a 0.2142-competitive algorithm for this problem. We also show that any randomized algorithm for this problem cannot be more than 0.4605-competitive. This is the first upper bound strictly less than 0.5, which implies the intrinsic challenge of knapsack constraint. We show how to naturally implement our optimal threshold distributions in the warehouses of a Latin American chain department store. We run simulations on their order data, which demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Computation Algorithms for Knapsack: impossibility results, and how to avoid them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01543v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local Computation Algorithms (LCA), as introduced by Rubinfeld, Tamir, Vardi, and Xie (2011), are a type of ultra-efficient algorithms which, given access to a (large) input for a given computational task, are required to provide fast query access to a consistent output solution, without maintaining a state between queries. This paradigm of computation in particular allows for hugely distributed algorithms, where independent instances of a given LCA provide consistent access to a common output solution. The past decade has seen a significant amount of work on LCAs, by and large focusing on graph problems. In this paper, we initiate the study of Local Computation Algorithms for perhaps the archetypal combinatorial optimization problem, Knapsack. We first establish strong impossibility results, ruling out the existence of any non-trivial LCA for Knapsack as several of its relaxations. We then show how equipping the LCA with additional access to the Knapsack instance, namely, weighted item sampling, allows one to circumvent these impossibility results, and obtain sublinear-time and query LCAs. Our positive result draws on a connection to the recent notion of reproducibility for learning algorithms (Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell, 2022), a connection we believe to be of independent interest for the design of LCAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Assignment and Knapsack Problems in the Random-Order Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01486v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study different online optimization problems in the random-order model. There is a finite set of bins with known capacity and a finite set of items arriving in a random order. Upon arrival of an item, its size and its value for each of the bins is revealed and it has to be decided immediately and irrevocably to which bin the item is assigned, or to not assign the item at all. In this setting, an algorithm is $\alpha$-competitive if the total value of all items assigned to the bins is at least an $\alpha$-fraction of the total value of an optimal assignment that knows all items beforehand. We give an algorithm that is $\alpha$-competitive with $\alpha = (1-\ln(2))/2 \approx 1/6.52$ improving upon the previous best algorithm with $\alpha \approx 1/6.99$ for the generalized assignment problem and the previous best algorithm with $\alpha \approx 1/6.65$ for the integral knapsack problem. We then study the fractional knapsack problem where we have a single bin and it is also allowed to pack items fractionally. For that case, we obtain an algorithm that is $\alpha$-competitive with $\alpha = 1/e \approx 1/2.71$ improving on the previous best algorithm with $\alpha = 1/4.39$. We further show that this competitive ratio is the best-possible for deterministic algorithms in this model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Approximation Algorithms for Three-Dimensional Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19365v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the three-dimensional Knapsack (3DK) problem, in which we are given a set of axis-aligned cuboids with associated profits and an axis-aligned cube knapsack. The objective is to find a non-overlapping axis-aligned packing (by translation) of the maximum profit subset of cuboids into the cube. The previous best approximation algorithm is due to Diedrich, Harren, Jansen, Th\"{o}le, and Thomas (2008), who gave a $(7+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for 3DK and a $(5+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the variant when the items can be rotated by 90 degrees around any axis, for any constant $\varepsilon>0$. Chleb\'{\i}k and Chleb\'{\i}kov\'{a} (2009) showed that the problem does not admit an asymptotic polynomial-time approximation scheme. We provide an improved polynomial-time $(139/29+\varepsilon) \approx 4.794$-approximation algorithm for 3DK and $(30/7+\varepsilon) \approx 4.286$-approximation when rotations by 90 degrees are allowed. We also provide improved approximation algorithms for several variants such as the cardinality case (when all items have the same profit) and uniform profit-density case (when the profit of an item is equal to its volume). Our key technical contribution is container packing -- a structured packing in 3D such that all items are assigned into a constant number of containers, and each container is packed using a specific strategy based on its type. We first show the existence of highly profitable container packings. Thereafter, we show that one can find near-optimal container packing efficiently using a variant of the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP).</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Bandwidth Observation Sharing for Multi-Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Intelligent Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09975v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation is increasingly crucial in various domains, including disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse and manufacturing automation. Robot teams often must operate in highly dynamic environments and under strict bandwidth constraints imposed by communication infrastructure, rendering effective observation sharing within the system a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel optimal communication scheme, Intelligent Knapsack (iKnap), for multi-robot navigation in dynamic environments under bandwidth constraints. We model multi-robot communication as belief propagation in a graph of inferential agents. We then formulate the combinatorial optimization for observation sharing as a 0/1 knapsack problem, where each potential pairwise communication between robots is assigned a decision-making utility to be weighed against its bandwidth cost, and the system has some cumulative bandwidth limit. We evaluate our approach in a simulated robotic warehouse with human workers using ROS2 and the Open Robotics Middleware Framework. Compared to state-of-the-art broadcast-based optimal communication schemes, iKnap yields significant improvements in navigation performance with respect to scenario complexity while maintaining a similar runtime. Furthermore, iKnap utilizes allocated bandwidth and observational resources more efficiently than existing approaches, especially in very low-resource and high-uncertainty settings. Based on these results, we claim that the proposed method enables more robust collaboration for multi-robot teams in real-world navigation problems.</p></details> |  |

They are based on a sequence of three lectures in CMU course on Advanced Approximation Algorithms in Fall'21 that used the KMN result to introduce the Sum-of-Squares method for algorithm design. The treatment in these notes uses the pseudo-distribution view of solutions to the sum-of-squares SDPs and only rely on a few basic, reusable results about pseudo-distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative-enhanced optimization for knapsack problems: an industry-relevant study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04928v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is a crucial task in various industries such as logistics, aviation, manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and insurance, where finding the best solution to a problem can result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency. Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bandits with Anytime Knapsacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18560v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider bandits with anytime knapsacks (BwAK), a novel version of the BwK problem where there is an \textit{anytime} cost constraint instead of a total cost budget. This problem setting introduces additional complexities as it mandates adherence to the constraint throughout the decision-making process. We propose SUAK, an algorithm that utilizes upper confidence bounds to identify the optimal mixture of arms while maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation. SUAK is an adaptive algorithm that strategically utilizes the available budget in each round in the decision-making process and skips a round when it is possible to violate the anytime cost constraint. In particular, SUAK slightly under-utilizes the available cost budget to reduce the need for skipping rounds. We show that SUAK attains the same problem-dependent regret upper bound of $ O(K \log T)$ established in prior work under the simpler BwK framework. Finally, we provide simulations to verify the utility of SUAK in practical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Nearly Quadratic-Time FPTAS for Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07821v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the classic Knapsack problem and propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) that runs in $\widetilde{O}(n + (1/\varepsilon)^2)$ time. This improves upon the $\widetilde{O}(n + (1/\varepsilon)^{11/5})$-time algorithm by Deng, Jin, and Mao [\textit{Proceedings of the 2023 Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2023}]. Our algorithm is the best possible (up to a polylogarithmic factor) conditioned on the conjecture that $(\min, +)$-convolution has no truly subquadratic-time algorithm, since this conjecture implies that Knapsack has no $O((n + 1/\varepsilon)^{2-\delta})$-time FPTAS for any constant $\delta > 0$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Firefly-Genetic Algorithm for Single and Multi-dimensional 0-1 Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14775v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges faced by algorithms, such as the Firefly Algorithm (FA) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), in constrained optimization problems. While both algorithms perform well for unconstrained problems, their effectiveness diminishes when constraints are introduced due to limitations in exploration, exploitation, and constraint handling. To overcome these challenges, a hybrid FAGA algorithm is proposed, combining the strengths of both algorithms. The hybrid algorithm is validated by solving unconstrained benchmark functions and constrained optimization problems, including design engineering problems and combinatorial problems such as the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. The proposed algorithm delivers improved solution accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional optimization algorithm. This paper outlines the development and structure of the hybrid algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness in handling complex optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation Schemes for Geometric Knapsack for Packing Spheres and Fat Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03981v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the geometric knapsack problem in which we are given a set of $d$-dimensional objects (each with associated profits) and the goal is to find the maximum profit subset that can be packed non-overlappingly into a given $d$-dimensional (unit hypercube) knapsack. Even if $d=2$ and all input objects are disks, this problem is known to be \textsf{NP}-hard [Demaine, Fekete, Lang, 2010]. In this paper, we give polynomial time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the following types of input objects in any constant dimension $d$: - disks and hyperspheres, - a class of fat convex polygons that generalizes regular $k$-gons for $k\ge 5$ (formally, polygons with a constant number of edges, whose lengths are in a bounded range, and in which each angle is strictly larger than $\pi/2$), - arbitrary fat convex objects that are sufficiently small compared to the knapsack. We remark that in our \textsf{PTAS} for disks and hyperspheres, we output the computed set of objects, but for a $O_\varepsilon(1)$ of them, we determine their coordinates only up to an exponentially small error. However, it is unclear whether there always exists a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution that uses only rational coordinates for the disks' centers. We leave this as an open problem that is related to well-studied geometric questions in the realm of circle packing.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of the work appeared in the proceedings of the 51st EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP) 2024</p></details> |
| **[The complexity of knapsack problems in wreath products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08086v2)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove new complexity results for computational problems in certain wreath products of groups and (as an application) for free solvable group. For a finitely generated group we study the so-called power word problem (does a given expression $u_1^{k_1} \ldots u_d^{k_d}$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d$ are words over the group generators and $k_1, \ldots, k_d$ are binary encoded integers, evaluate to the group identity?) and knapsack problem (does a given equation $u_1^{x_1} \ldots u_d^{x_d} = v$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d,v$ are words over the group generators and $x_1,\ldots,x_d$ are variables, has a solution in the natural numbers). We prove that the power word problem for wreath products of the form $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$ with $G$ nilpotent and iterated wreath products of free abelian groups belongs to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. As an application of the latter, the power word problem for free solvable groups is in $\mathsf{TC}^0$. On the other hand we show that for wreath products $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is a so called uniformly strongly efficiently non-solvable group (which form a large subclass of non-solvable groups), the power word problem is $\mathsf{coNP}$-hard. For the knapsack problem we show $\mathsf{NP}$-completeness for iterated wreath products of free abelian groups and hence free solvable groups. Moreover, the knapsack problem for every wreath product $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is uniformly efficiently non-solvable, is $\Sigma^2_p$-hard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation Algorithms for Correlated Knapsack Orienteering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16566v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the {\em correlated knapsack orienteering} (CSKO) problem: we are given a travel budget $B$, processing-time budget $W$, finite metric space $(V,d)$ with root $\rho\in V$, where each vertex is associated with a job with possibly correlated random size and random reward that become known only when the job completes. Random variables are independent across different vertices. The goal is to compute a $\rho$-rooted path of length at most $B$, in a possibly adaptive fashion, that maximizes the reward collected from jobs that are processed by time $W$. To our knowledge, CSKO has not been considered before, though prior work has considered the uncorrelated problem, {\em stochastic knapsack orienteering}, and {\em correlated orienteering}, which features only one budget constraint on the {\em sum} of travel-time and processing-times. We show that the {\em adaptivity gap of CSKO is not a constant, and is at least $\Omega\bigl(\max\sqrt{\log{B}},\sqrt{\log\log{W}}\}\bigr)$}. Complementing this, we devise {\em non-adaptive} algorithms that obtain: (a) $O(\log\log W)$-approximation in quasi-polytime; and (b) $O(\log W)$-approximation in polytime. We obtain similar guarantees for CSKO with cancellations, wherein a job can be cancelled before its completion time, foregoing its reward. We also consider the special case of CSKO, wherein job sizes are weighted Bernoulli distributions, and more generally where the distributions are supported on at most two points (2-CSKO). Although weighted Bernoulli distributions suffice to yield an $\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log B})$ adaptivity-gap lower bound for (uncorrelated) {\em stochastic orienteering}, we show that they are easy instances for CSKO. We develop non-adaptive algorithms that achieve $O(1)$-approximation in polytime for weighted Bernoulli distributions, and in $(n+\log B)^{O(\log W)}$-time for the more general case of 2-CSKO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of APPROX 2024 paper</p></details> |
| **[Shadoks Approach to Knapsack Polygonal Packing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20123v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2024 edition of the CG:SHOP Challenge focused on the knapsack polygonal packing problem. Each instance consists of a convex polygon known as the container and a multiset of items, where each item is a simple polygon with an associated integer value. A feasible packing solution places a selection of the items inside the container without overlapping and using only translations. The goal is to achieve a packing that maximizes the total value of the items in the solution. Our approach to win first place is divided into two main steps. First, we generate promising initial solutions using two strategies: one based on integer linear programming and the other on employing a combination of geometric greedy heuristics. In the second step, we enhance these solutions through local search techniques, which involve repositioning items and exploring potential replacements to improve the total value of the packing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A quantum algorithm for solving 0-1 Knapsack problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06623v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we present two novel contributions for achieving quantum advantage in solving difficult optimisation problems, both in theory and foreseeable practice. (1) We introduce the "Quantum Tree Generator", an approach to generate in superposition all feasible solutions of a given instance, yielding together with amplitude amplification the optimal solutions for 0-1 knapsack problems. The QTG offers massive memory savings and enables competitive runtimes compared to the classical state-of-the-art knapsack solvers (such as COMBO, Gurobi, CP-SAT, Greedy) already for instances involving as few as 100 variables. (2) By introducing a new runtime calculation technique that exploits logging data from the classical solver COMBO, we can predict the runtime of our method way beyond the range of existing quantum platforms and simulators, for various benchmark instances with up to 600 variables. Combining both of these innovations, we demonstrate the QTG's potential practical quantum advantage for large-scale problems, indicating an effective approach for combinatorial optimisation problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+13 ...</summary><p>6+13 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Online Unbounded Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02045v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the competitive ratio and the advice complexity of the online unbounded knapsack problem. An instance is given as a sequence of n items with a size and a value each, and an algorithm has to decide how often to pack each item into a knapsack of bounded capacity. The items are given online and the total size of the packed items must not exceed the knapsack's capacity, while the objective is to maximize the total value of the packed items. While each item can only be packed once in the classical 0-1 knapsack problem, the unbounded version allows for items to be packed multiple times. We show that the simple unbounded knapsack problem, where the size of each item is equal to its value, allows for a competitive ratio of 2. We also analyze randomized algorithms and show that, in contrast to the 0-1 knapsack problem, one uniformly random bit cannot improve an algorithm's performance. More randomness lowers the competitive ratio to less than 1.736, but it can never be below 1.693. In the advice complexity setting, we measure how many bits of information the algorithm has to know to achieve some desired solution quality. For the simple unbounded knapsack problem, one advice bit lowers the competitive ratio to 3/2. While this cannot be improved with fewer than log(n) advice bits for instances of length n, a competitive ratio of 1+epsilon can be achieved with O(log(n/epsilon)/epsilon) advice bits for any epsilon>0. We further show that no amount of advice bounded by a function f(n) allows an algorithm to be optimal. We also study the online general unbounded knapsack problem and show that it does not allow for any bounded competitive ratio for deterministic and randomized algorithms, as well as for algorithms using fewer than log(n) advice bits. We also provide an algorithm that uses O(log(n/epsilon)/epsilon) advice bits to achieve a competitive ratio of 1+epsilon for any epsilon>0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximately Counting Knapsack Solutions in Subquadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22267v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the classic #Knapsack problem, which asks to count the Boolean points $(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\{0,1\}^n$ in a given half-space $\sum_{i=1}^nW_ix_i\le T$. This #P-complete problem admits $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation. Before this work, [Dyer, STOC 2003]'s $\tilde{O}(n^{2.5}+n^2{\epsilon^{-2}})$-time randomized approximation scheme remains the fastest known in the natural regime of $\epsilon\ge 1/polylog(n)$. In this paper, we give a randomized $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm in $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}{\epsilon^{-2}})$ time (in the standard word-RAM model), achieving the first sub-quadratic dependence on $n$. Such sub-quadratic running time is rare in the approximate counting literature in general, as a large class of algorithms naturally faces a quadratic-time barrier. Our algorithm follows Dyer's framework, which reduces #Knapsack to the task of sampling (and approximately counting) solutions in a randomly rounded instance with poly(n)-bounded integer weights. We refine Dyer's framework using the following ideas: - We decrease the sample complexity of Dyer's Monte Carlo method, by proving some structural lemmas for typical points near the input hyperplane via hitting-set arguments, and appropriately setting the rounding scale. - Instead of running a vanilla dynamic program on the rounded instance, we employ techniques from the growing field of pseudopolynomial-time Subset Sum algorithms, such as FFT, divide-and-conquer, and balls-into-bins hashing of [Bringmann, SODA 2017]. We also need other ingredients, including a surprising application of the recent Bounded Monotone (max,+)-Convolution algorithm by [Chi-Duan-Xie-Zhang, STOC 2022] (adapted by [Bringmann-D\"urr-Polak, ESA 2024]), the notion of sum-approximation from [Gawrychowski-Markin-Weimann, ICALP 2018]'s #Knapsack approximation scheme, and a two-phase extension of Dyer's framework for handling tiny weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SODA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Maximizing a Submodular Function with Bounded Curvature under an Unknown Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09668v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under an unknown knapsack constraint. A solution to this problem is a policy that decides which item to pack next based on the past packing history. The robustness factor of a policy is the worst case ratio of the solution obtained by following the policy and an optimal solution that knows the knapsack capacity. We develop a policy with a robustness factor that is decreasing in the curvature $c$ of the submodular function. For the extreme cases $c=0$ corresponding to an additive objective function, it matches a previously known and best possible robustness factor of $1/2$. For the other extreme case of $c=1$ it yields a robustness factor of $\approx 0.35$ improving over the best previously known robustness factor of $\approx 0.06$. The analysis of our policy relies on a greedy algorithm that is a slight modification of Wolsey's greedy algorithm for the submodular knapsack problem with a known knapsack constraint. We obtain tight approximation guarantees for both of these algorithms in the setting of a submodular objective function with curvature $c$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Packing a Knapsack with Items Owned by Strategic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06080v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a scenario within the field of mechanism design without money where a mechanism designer is interested in selecting items with maximum total value under a knapsack constraint. The items, however, are controlled by strategic agents who aim to maximize the total value of their items in the knapsack. This is a natural setting, e.g., when agencies select projects for funding, companies select products for sale in their shops, or hospitals schedule MRI scans for the day. A mechanism governing the packing of the knapsack is strategyproof if no agent can benefit from hiding items controlled by them to the mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that are strategyproof and $\alpha$-approximate in the sense that they always approximate the maximum value of the knapsack by a factor of $\alpha \in [0,1]$. First, we give a deterministic mechanism that is $\frac{1}{3}$-approximate. For the special case where all items have unit density, we design a $\frac{1}{\phi}$-approximate mechanism where $1/\phi \approx 0.618$ is the inverse of the golden ratio. This result is tight as we show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism with a better approximation exists. We further give randomized mechanisms with approximation guarantees of $1/2$ for the general case and $2/3$ for the case of unit densities. For both cases, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve an approximation guarantee better than $1/(5\phi -7)\approx 0.917$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knapsack with Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Hitting Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01057v4)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, with vertex weights $(w(u))_{u\in\mathcal{V}}$, vertex values $(\alpha(u))_{u\in\mathcal{V}}$, a knapsack size $s$, and a target value $d$, the \vcknapsack problem is to determine if there exists a subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathcal{V}$ of vertices such that $\mathcal{U}$ forms a vertex cover, $w(\mathcal{U})=\sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}} w(u) \le s$, and $\alpha(\mathcal{U})=\sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}} \alpha(u) \ge d$. In this paper, we closely study the \vcknapsack problem and its variations, such as \vcknapsackbudget, \minimalvcknapsack, and \minimumvcknapsack, for both general graphs and trees. We first prove that the \vcknapsack problem belongs to the complexity class \NPC and then study the complexity of the other variations. We generalize the problem to \setc and \hs versions and design polynomial time $H_g$-factor approximation algorithm for the \setckp problem and d-factor approximation algorithm for \hstp using primal dual method. We further show that \setcks and \hsmb are hard to approximate in polynomial time. Additionally, we develop a fixed parameter tractable algorithm running in time $8^{\mathcal{O}({\rm tw})}\cdot n\cdot {\sf min}\{s,d\}$ where ${\rm tw},s,d,n$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, the size of the knapsack, the target value of the knapsack, and the number of items for the \minimalvcknapsack problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Parallel Algorithm for Non-Monotone Submodular Maximization under Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04415v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes an efficient parallel algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint problem over the ground set of size $n$. Our algorithm improves the best approximation factor of the existing parallel one from $8+\epsilon$ to $7+\epsilon$ with $O(\log n)$ adaptive complexity. The key idea of our approach is to create a new alternate threshold algorithmic framework. This strategy alternately constructs two disjoint candidate solutions within a constant number of sequence rounds. Then, the algorithm boosts solution quality without sacrificing the adaptive complexity. Extensive experimental studies on three applications, Revenue Maximization, Image Summarization, and Maximum Weighted Cut, show that our algorithm not only significantly increases solution quality but also requires comparative adaptivity to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the Thirty-Third International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), Main Track</p></details> |

The central issue is to determine a cost allocation to each user that, in total, recovers as much as possible of the actual cost while satisfying a stabilizing condition known as the {\it core property}. The ratio between the total service cost and the cost recovered from users has been studied previously, with seminal papers of Deng, Ibaraki, \& Nagomochi and Goemans \& Skutella linking this {\it price-of-fair-sharing} to the integrality gap of an associated LP relaxation. Motivated by an application of cost allocation for network design for LPWANs, an emerging IoT technology, we investigate a general class of CIPs and give the first non-trivial price-of-fair-sharing bounds by using the natural LP relaxation strengthened with knapsack-cover inequalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these LP-based methods outperform previously known methods on an LPWAN-derived CIP data set. We also obtain analogous results for a more general setting in which the service provider also gets to select the subset of users, and the mechanism to elicit users' private utilities should be group-strategyproof. The key to obtaining this result is a simplified and improved analysis for a cross-monotone cost-allocation mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper appearing in proceedings of WAOA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fine Grained Lower Bounds for Multidimensional Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10146v1)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the $d$-dimensional knapsack problem. We are given a set of items, each with a $d$-dimensional cost vector and a profit, along with a $d$-dimensional budget vector. The goal is to select a set of items that do not exceed the budget in all dimensions and maximize the total profit. A PTAS with running time $n^{\Theta(d/\varepsilon)}$ has long been known for this problem, where $\varepsilon$ is the error parameter and $n$ is the encoding size. Despite decades of active research, the best running time of a PTAS has remained $O(n^{\lceil d/\varepsilon \rceil - d})$. Unfortunately, existing lower bounds only cover the special case with two dimensions $d = 2$, and do not answer whether there is a $n^{o(d/\varepsilon)}$-time PTAS for larger values of $d$. The status of exact algorithms is similar: there is a simple $O(n \cdot W^d)$-time (exact) dynamic programming algorithm, where $W$ is the maximum budget, but there is no lower bound which explains the strong exponential dependence on $d$. In this work, we show that the running times of the best-known PTAS and exact algorithm cannot be improved up to a polylogarithmic factor assuming Gap-ETH. Our techniques are based on a robust reduction from 2-CSP, which embeds 2-CSP constraints into a desired number of dimensions, exhibiting tight trade-off between $d$ and $\varepsilon$ for most regimes of the parameters. Informally, we obtain the following main results for $d$-dimensional knapsack. No $n^{o(d/\varepsilon \cdot 1/(\log(d/\varepsilon))^2)}$-time $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation for every $\varepsilon = O(1/\log d)$. No $(n+W)^{o(d/\log d)}$-time exact algorithm (assuming ETH). No $n^{o(\sqrt{d})}$-time $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation for constant $\varepsilon$. $(d \cdot \log W)^{O(d^2)} + n^{O(1)}$-time $\Omega(1/\sqrt{d})$-approximation and a matching $n^{O(1)}$-time lower~bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Practical Benchmarks of Ising Machines: A Case Study on the Quadratic Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19175v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization has wide applications from industry to natural science. Ising machines bring an emerging computing paradigm for efficiently solving a combinatorial optimization problem by searching a ground state of a given Ising model. Current cutting-edge Ising machines achieve fast sampling of near-optimal solutions of the max-cut problem. However, for problems with additional constraint conditions, their advantages have been hardly shown due to difficulties in handling the constraints. In this work, we focus on benchmarks of Ising machines on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To bring out their practical performance, we propose fast two-stage post-processing for Ising machines, which makes handling the constraint easier. Simulation based on simulated annealing shows that the proposed method substantially improves the solving performance of Ising machines and the improvement is robust to a choice of encoding of the constraint condition. Through evaluation using an Ising machine called Amplify Annealing Engine, the proposed method is shown to dramatically improve its solving performance on the QKP. These results are a crucial step toward showing advantages of Ising machines on practical problems involving various constraint conditions.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Provably Good Solutions to the Knapsack Problem via Neural Networks of Bounded Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14105v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of a satisfying and rigorous mathematical understanding of the performance of neural networks is a major challenge in artificial intelligence. Against this background, we study the expressive power of neural networks through the example of the classical NP-hard Knapsack Problem. Our main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with rectified linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a Knapsack instance and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. We show that an RNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum Knapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions. We also prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of the computed Knapsack solution: for Knapsack instances consisting of $n$ items, an RNN of depth five and width $w$ computes a solution of value at least $1-\mathcal{O}(n^2/\sqrt{w})$ times the optimum solution value. Our results build upon a classical dynamic programming formulation of the Knapsack Problem as well as a careful rounding of profit values that are also at the core of the well-known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Knapsack Problem. A carefully conducted computational study qualitatively supports our theoretical size bounds. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized to many other combinatorial optimization problems that admit dynamic programming solution methods, such as various Shortest Path Problems, the Longest Common Subsequence Problem, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors' accepted manuscript for the INFORMS Journal on Computing.

| **[A Re-solving Heuristic for Dynamic Assortment Optimization with Knapsack Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05564v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization highly non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Even Faster Knapsack via Rectangular Monotone Min-Plus Convolution and Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05681v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for the Knapsack problem that has running time $\widetilde{O}(n + t\sqrt{p_{\max}})$, where $n$ is the number of items, $t$ is the knapsack capacity, and $p_{\max}$ is the maximum item profit. This improves over the $\widetilde{O}(n + t \, p_{\max})$-time algorithm based on the convolution and prediction technique by Bateni et al.~(STOC 2018). Moreover, we give some evidence, based on a strengthening of the Min-Plus Convolution Hypothesis, that our running time might be optimal. Our algorithm uses two new technical tools, which might be of independent interest. First, we generalize the $\widetilde{O}(n^{1.5})$-time algorithm for bounded monotone min-plus convolution by Chi et al.~(STOC 2022) to the \emph{rectangular} case where the range of entries can be different from the sequence length. Second, we give a reduction from general knapsack instances to \emph{balanced} instances, where all items have nearly the same profit-to-weight ratio, up to a constant factor. Using these techniques, we can also obtain algorithms that run in time $\widetilde{O}(n + OPT\sqrt{w_{\max}})$, $\widetilde{O}(n + (nw_{\max}p_{\max})^{1/3}t^{2/3})$, and $\widetilde{O}(n + (nw_{\max}p_{\max})^{1/3} OPT^{2/3})$, where $OPT$ is the optimal total profit and $w_{\max}$ is the maximum item weight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competitive Algorithms for Online Knapsack with Succinct Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18752v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the online knapsack problem, the goal is to pack items arriving online with different values and weights into a capacity-limited knapsack to maximize the total value of the accepted items. We study \textit{learning-augmented} algorithms for this problem, which aim to use machine-learned predictions to move beyond pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Existing learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack consider relatively complicated prediction models that give an algorithm substantial information about the input, such as the total weight of items at each value. In practice, such predictions can be error-sensitive and difficult to learn. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a family of learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack that use \emph{succinct predictions}. In particular, the machine-learned prediction given to the algorithm is just a single value or interval that estimates the minimum value of any item accepted by an offline optimal solution. By leveraging a relaxation to online \emph{fractional} knapsack, we design algorithms that can leverage such succinct predictions in both the trusted setting (i.e., with perfect prediction) and the untrusted setting, where we prove that a simple meta-algorithm achieves a nearly optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. Empirically, we show that our algorithms significantly outperform baselines that do not use predictions and often outperform algorithms based on more complex prediction models.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[An EPTAS for Cardinality Constrained Multiple Knapsack via Iterative Randomized Rounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12622v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In [Math. Oper. Res., 2011], Fleischer et al. introduced a powerful technique for solving the generic class of separable assignment problems (SAP), in which a set of items of given values and weights needs to be packed into a set of bins subject to separable assignment constraints, so as to maximize the total value. The approach of Fleischer at al. relies on solving a configuration LP and sampling a configuration for each bin independently based on the LP solution. While there is a SAP variant for which this approach yields the best possible approximation ratio, for various special cases, there are discrepancies between the approximation ratios obtained using the above approach and the state-of-the-art approximations. This raises the following natural question: Can we do better by iteratively solving the configuration LP and sampling a few bins at a time? To assess the potential gain from iterative randomized rounding, we consider as a case study one interesting SAP variant, namely, Uniform Cardinality Constrained Multiple Knapsack, for which we answer this question affirmatively. The input is a set of items, each has a value and a weight, and a set of uniform capacity bins. The goal is to assign a subset of the items of maximum total value to the bins such that $(i)$ the capacity of any bin is not exceeded, and $(ii)$ the number of items assigned to each bin satisfies a given cardinality constraint. While the technique of Fleischer et al. yields a $\left(1-\frac{1}{e}\right)$-approximation for the problem, we show that iterative randomized rounding leads to an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS), thus essentially resolving the complexity status of the problem. Our analysis of iterative randomized rounding can be useful for solving other SAP variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding and Exploring Promising Search Space for the 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03918v3)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with many engineering applications. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm combining evolutionary computation with the exact algorithm to solve the 0-1 MKP. It maintains a set of solutions and utilizes the information from the population to extract good partial assignments. To find high-quality solutions, an exact algorithm is applied to explore the promising search space specified by the good partial assignments. The new solutions are used to update the population. Thus, the good partial assignments evolve towards a better direction with the improvement of the population. Extensive experimentation with commonly used benchmark sets shows that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms, TPTEA and DQPSO, as well as the commercial solver CPlex. It finds better solutions than the existing algorithms and provides new lower bounds for 10 large and hard instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized heuristic repair for large-scale multidimensional knapsack problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15569v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem whose solution is determining a subset of maximum total profit items that do not violate capacity constraints. Due to its hardness, large-scale MKP instances are usually a target for metaheuristics, a context in which effective feasibility maintenance strategies are crucial. In 1998, Chu and Beasley proposed an effective heuristic repair that is still relevant for recent metaheuristics. However, due to its deterministic nature, the diversity of solutions such heuristic provides is insufficient for long runs. As a result, the search for new solutions ceases after a while. This paper proposes an efficiency-based randomization strategy for the heuristic repair that increases the variability of the repaired solutions without deteriorating quality and improves the overall results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascading-Tree Algorithm for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem (In Memory of Heiner M{ü}ller-Merbach, a Former President of IFORS)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13450v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In operations research, the Knapsack Problem (KP) is one of the classical optimization problems that has been widely studied. The KP has several variants and, in this paper, we address the binary KP, where for a given knapsack (with limited capacity) as well as a number of items, each of them has its own weight (volume or cost) and value, the objective consists in finding a selection of items such that the total value of the selected items is maximized and the capacity limit of the knapsack is respected. In this paper, in memorial of Prof. Dr. Heiner M{\"u}ller-Merbach, a former president of IFORS, we address the binary KP and revisit a classical algorithm, named cascading-tree branch-and-bound algorithm, that was originally introduced by him in 1978. However, the algorithm is surprisingly absent from the scientific literature because the paper was published in a German journal. We carried out computational experiments in order to compare the algorithm versus some classic methods. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the interesting idea used in the cascading-tree algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Average sensitivity of the Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13343v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In resource allocation, we often require that the output allocation of an algorithm is stable against input perturbation because frequent reallocation is costly and untrustworthy. Varma and Yoshida (SODA'21) formalized this requirement for algorithms as the notion of average sensitivity. Here, the average sensitivity of an algorithm on an input instance is, roughly speaking, the average size of the symmetric difference of the output for the instance and that for the instance with one item deleted, where the average is taken over the deleted item. In this work, we consider the average sensitivity of the knapsack problem, a representative example of a resource allocation problem. We first show a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the knapsack problem with average sensitivity $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$. Then, we complement this result by showing that any $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm has average sensitivity $\Omega(\epsilon^{-1})$. As an application of our algorithm, we consider the incremental knapsack problem in the random-order setting, where the goal is to maintain a good solution while items arrive one by one in a random order. Specifically, we show that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with amortized recourse $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$ and amortized update time $O(\log n+f_\epsilon)$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $f_\epsilon>0$ is a value depending on $\epsilon$.</p></details> | 23 pages, ESA 2022 |

The problem recently attracted a lot of attention due to its applications in various domains of combination optimization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We improve the approximation factor of the fastest deterministic algorithm from $6+\epsilon$ to $5+\epsilon$ while keeping the best query complexity of $O(n)$, where $\epsilon >0$ is a constant parameter. Our technique is based on optimizing the performance of two components: the threshold greedy subroutine and the building of two disjoint sets as candidate solutions. Besides, by carefully analyzing the cost of candidate solutions, we obtain a tighter approximation factor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Bidding in Knapsack Auctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07928v3)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines knapsack auctions as a method to solve the knapsack problem with incomplete information, where object values are private and sizes are public. We analyze three auction types-uniform price (UP), discriminatory price (DP), and generalized second price (GSP)-to determine efficient resource allocation in these settings. Using a Greedy algorithm for allocating objects, we analyze bidding behavior, revenue and efficiency of these three auctions using theory, lab experiments, and AI-enriched simulations. Our results suggest that the uniform-price auction has the highest level of truthful bidding and efficiency while the discriminatory price and the generalized second-price auctions are superior in terms of revenue generation. This study not only deepens the understanding of auction-based approaches to NP-hard problems but also provides practical insights for market design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Fairness in Online Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13293v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The online knapsack problem is a classic problem in the field of online algorithms. Its canonical version asks how to pack items of different values and weights arriving online into a capacity-limited knapsack so as to maximize the total value of the admitted items. Although optimal competitive algorithms are known for this problem, they may be fundamentally unfair, i.e., individual items may be treated inequitably in different ways. We formalize a practically-relevant notion of time fairness which effectively models a trade off between static and dynamic pricing in a motivating application such as cloud resource allocation, and show that existing algorithms perform poorly under this metric. We propose a parameterized deterministic algorithm where the parameter precisely captures the Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness (static pricing) and competitiveness (dynamic pricing). We show that randomization is theoretically powerful enough to be simultaneously competitive and fair; however, it does not work well in experiments. To further improve the trade-off between fairness and competitiveness, we develop a nearly-optimal learning-augmented algorithm which is fair, consistent, and robust (competitive), showing substantial performance improvements in numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024. 26 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms with Sliding Window Selection for the Dynamic Chance-Constrained Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08219v1)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms are particularly effective for optimisation problems with dynamic and stochastic components. We propose multi-objective evolutionary approaches for the knapsack problem with stochastic profits under static and dynamic weight constraints. The chance-constrained problem model allows us to effectively capture the stochastic profits and associate a confidence level to the solutions' profits. We consider a bi-objective formulation that maximises expected profit and minimises variance, which allows optimising the problem independent of a specific confidence level on the profit. We derive a three-objective formulation by relaxing the weight constraint into an additional objective. We consider the GSEMO algorithm with standard and a sliding window-based parent selection to evaluate the objective formulations. Moreover, we modify fitness formulations and algorithms for the dynamic problem variant to store some infeasible solutions to cater to future changes. We conduct experimental investigations on both problems using the proposed problem formulations and algorithms. Our results show that three-objective approaches outperform approaches that use bi-objective formulations, and they further improve when GSEMO uses sliding window selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using 3-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms for the Dynamic Chance Constrained Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06014v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world optimization problems often involve stochastic and dynamic components. Evolutionary algorithms are particularly effective in these scenarios, as they can easily adapt to uncertain and changing environments but often uncertainty and dynamic changes are studied in isolation. In this paper, we explore the use of 3-objective evolutionary algorithms for the chance constrained knapsack problem with dynamic constraints. In our setting, the weights of the items are stochastic and the knapsack's capacity changes over time. We introduce a 3-objective formulation that is able to deal with the stochastic and dynamic components at the same time and is independent of the confidence level required for the constraint. This new approach is then compared to the 2-objective formulation which is limited to a single confidence level. We evaluate the approach using two different multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), namely the global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO) and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), across various benchmark scenarios. Our analysis highlights the advantages of the 3-objective formulation over the 2-objective formulation in addressing the dynamic chance constrained knapsack problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[0-1 Knapsack in Nearly Quadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04093v2)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for the fundamental \emph{0-1 Knapsack} problem. Recent research interest has focused on its fine-grained complexity with respect to the number of items $n$ and the \emph{maximum item weight} $w_{\max}$. Under $(\min,+)$-convolution hypothesis, 0-1 Knapsack does not have $O((n+w_{\max})^{2-\delta})$ time algorithms (Cygan-Mucha-W\k{e}grzycki-W\l{}odarczyk 2017 and K\"{u}nnemann-Paturi-Schneider 2017). On the upper bound side, currently the fastest algorithm runs in $\tilde O(n + w_{\max}^{12/5})$ time (Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang 2023), improving the earlier $O(n + w_{\max}^3)$-time algorithm by Polak, Rohwedder, and W\k{e}grzycki (2021). In this paper, we close this gap between the upper bound and the conditional lower bound (up to subpolynomial factors): - The 0-1 Knapsack problem has a deterministic algorithm in $O(n + w_{\max}^{2}\log^4w_{\max})$ time. Our algorithm combines and extends several recent structural results and algorithmic techniques from the literature on knapsack-type problems: - We generalize the "fine-grained proximity" technique of Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang (2023) derived from the additive-combinatorial results of Bringmann and Wellnitz (2021) on dense subset sums. This allows us to bound the support size of the useful partial solutions in the dynamic program. - To exploit the small support size, our main technical component is a vast extension of the "witness propagation" method, originally designed by Deng, Mao, and Zhong (2023) for speeding up dynamic programming in the easier unbounded knapsack settings. To extend this approach to our 0-1 setting, we use a novel pruning method, as well as the two-level color-coding of Bringmann (2017) and the SMAWK algorithm on tall matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 co...</summary><p>v2 comment: To appear in STOC 2024. v1 comment: This paper supersedes an earlier manuscript arXiv:2307.09454 that contained weaker results.

| **[Convolution and Knapsack in Higher Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16117v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Knapsack problem, one is given the task of packing a knapsack of a given size with items in order to gain a packing with a high profit value. In recent years, a connection to the $(\max,+)$-convolution problem has been established, where knapsack solutions can be combined by building the convolution of two sequences. This observation has been used to give conditional lower bounds but also parameterized algorithms. In this paper we want to carry these results into higher dimension. We consider Knapsack where items are characterized by multiple properties - given through a vector - and a knapsack that has a capacity vector. The packing must now not exceed any of the given capacity constraints. In order to show a similar sub-quadratic lower bound we introduce a multi-dimensional version of convolution as well. Instead of combining sequences, we will generalize this problem and combine higher dimensional matrices. We will establish a few variants of these problems and prove that they are all equivalent in terms of algorithms that allow for a running time sub-quadratic in the number of entries of the matrix. We further develop a parameterized algorithm to solve higher dimensional Knapsack. The techniques we apply are inspired by an algorithm introduced by Axiotis and Tzamos. In general, we manage not only to extend their result to higher dimension. We will show that even for higher dimensional Knapsack, we can reduce the problem to convolution on one-dimensional sequences, leading to an $\mathcal{O}(d(n + D \cdot \max\{\Pi_{i=1}^d{t_i}, t_{\max}\log t_{\max}\} ))$ algorithm, where $D$ is the number of different weight vectors, $t$ the capacity vector and $d$ is the dimension of the problem. Finally we also modify this algorithm to handle items with negative weights to cross the bridge from solving not only Knapsack but also Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) in general.</p></details> |  |
| **[On contention resolution for the hypergraph matching, knapsack, and $k$-column sparse packing problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00041v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The contention resolution framework is a versatile rounding technique used as a part of the relaxation and rounding approach for solving constrained submodular function maximization problems. We apply this framework to the hypergraph matching, knapsack, and $k$-column sparse packing problems. In the hypergraph matching setting, we adapt the technique of Guruganesh, Lee (2018) to non-constructively prove that the correlation gap is at least $\frac{1-e^{-k}}{k}$ and provide a monotone $\left(b,\frac{1-e^{-bk}}{bk}\right)$-balanced contention resolution scheme, generalizing the results of Bruggmann, Zenklusen (2019). For the knapsack problem, we prove that the correlation gap of instances where exactly $k$ copies of each item fit into the knapsack is at least $\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2}$ and provide several monotone contention resolution schemes: a $\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2}$-balanced scheme for instances where all item sizes are strictly bigger than $\frac{1}{2}$, a $\frac{4}{9}$-balanced scheme for instances where all item sizes are at most $\frac{1}{2}$, and a $0.279$-balanced scheme for instances with arbitrary item sizes. For $k$-column sparse packing integer programs, we slightly modify the $\left(2k+o\left(k\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-CS-PIP based on the strengthened LP relaxation presented in Brubach et al. (2019) to obtain a $\frac{1}{4k+o\left(k\right)}$-balanced contention resolution scheme and hence a $\left(4k+o\left(k\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-CS-PIP based on the natural LP relaxation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis defended at ETH Zurich.

| **[$(1-ε)$-Approximation of Knapsack in Nearly Quadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07004v3)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knapsack is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical computer science. In the $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation setting, although there is a fine-grained lower bound of $(n + 1 / \epsilon) ^ {2 - o(1)}$ based on the $(\min, +)$-convolution hypothesis ([K{\"u}nnemann, Paturi and Stefan Schneider, ICALP 2017] and [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki and Wlodarczyk, 2017]), the best algorithm is randomized and runs in $\tilde O\left(n + (\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{11/5}/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})}\right)$ time [Deng, Jin and Mao, SODA 2023], and it remains an important open problem whether an algorithm with a running time that matches the lower bound (up to a sub-polynomial factor) exists. We answer the question positively by showing a deterministic $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation scheme for knapsack that runs in $\tilde O(n + (1 / \epsilon) ^ {2})$ time. We first extend a known lemma in a recursive way to reduce the problem to $n \epsilon$-additive approximation for $n$ items with profits in $[1, 2)$. Then we give a simple efficient geometry-based algorithm for the reduced problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A constant time complexity algorithm for the unbounded knapsack problem with bounded coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11320v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark instances for the unbounded knapsack problem are typically generated according to specific criteria within a given constant range $R$, and these instances can be referred to as the unbounded knapsack problem with bounded coefficients (UKPB). In order to increase the difficulty of solving these instances, the knapsack capacity $C$ is usually set to a very large value. Therefore, an exact algorithm that neither time complexity nor space complexity includes the capacity coefficient $C$ is highly anticipated. In this paper, we propose an exact algorithm with time complexity of $O(R^4)$ and space complexity of $O(R^3)$. The algorithm initially divides the multiset $N$ into two multisubsets, $N_1$ and $N_2$, based on the profit density of their types. For the multisubset $N_2$ composed of types with profit density lower than the maximum profit density type, we utilize a recent branch and bound (B\&B) result by Dey et al. (Math. Prog., pp 569-587, 2023) to determine the maximum selection number for types in $N_2$. We then employ the Unbounded-DP algorithm to exactly solve for the types in $N_2$. For the multisubset $N_1$ composed of the maximum profit density type and its counterparts with the same profit density, we transform it into a linear Diophantine equation and leverage relevant conclusions from the Frobenius problem to solve it efficiently. In particular, the proof techniques required by the algorithm are primarily covered in the first-year mathematics curriculum, which is convenient for subsequent researchers to grasp.</p></details> |  |
| **[An upper bound of the mutation probability in the genetic algorithm for general 0-1 knapsack problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11307v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important part of genetic algorithms (GAs), mutation operators is widely used in evolutionary algorithms to solve $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems because it can increase the population diversity of individual. Due to limitations in mathematical tools, the mutation probability of the mutation operator is primarily empirically set in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel reduction method for the 0-1 knapsack problem(0-1 KP) and an improved mutation operator (IMO) based on the assumption $\mathcal{NP}\neq\mathcal{P}$, along with the utilization of linear relaxation techniques and a recent result by Dey et al. (Math. Prog., pp 569-587, 2022). We employ this method to calculate an upper bound of the mutation probability in general instances of the 0-1 KP, and construct an instance where the mutation probability does not tend towards 0 as the problem size increases. Finally, we prove that the probability of the IMO hitting the optimal solution within only a single iteration in large-scale instances is superior to that of the traditional mutation operator.</p></details> |  |

This makes AE-QTS more similar to the real quantum search algorithm, Grover Search Algorithm, in abstract concept, while keeping the simplicity of the algorithm. Later, we demonstrate the AE-QTS on the classical combinatorial optimization 0/1 knapsack problem. Experimental results show that the AE-QTS outperforms other algorithms, including the QTS, by at least an average of 20% in all cases and even by 30% in some cases. Even as the problem complexity increases, the quality of the solutions found by our method remains superior to that of the QTS. These results prove that our method has better search performance.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Adversarial Knapsack and Secondary Effects of Common Information for Cyber Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10789v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variations of the Flip-It game have been applied to model network cyber operations. While Flip-It can accurately express uncertainty and loss of control, it imposes no essential resource constraints for operations. Capture the flag (CTF) style competitive games, such as Flip-It , entail uncertainties and loss of control, but also impose realistic constraints on resource use. As such, they bear a closer resemblance to actual cyber operations. We formalize a dynamical network control game for CTF competitions and detail the static game for each time step. The static game can be reformulated as instances of a novel optimization problem called Adversarial Knapsack (AK) or Dueling Knapsack (DK) when there are only two players. We define the Adversarial Knapsack optimization problems as a system of interacting Weighted Knapsack problems, and illustrate its applications to general scenarios involving multiple agents with conflicting optimization goals, e.g., cyber operations and CTF games in particular. Common awareness of the scenario, rewards, and costs will set the stage for a non-cooperative game. Critically, rational players may second guess that their AK solution -- with a better response and higher reward -- is possible if opponents predictably play their AK optimal solutions. Thus, secondary reasoning which such as belief modeling of opponents play can be anticipated for rational players and will introduce a type of non-stability where players maneuver for slight reward differentials. To analyze this, we provide the best-response algorithms and simulation software to consider how rational agents may heuristically search for maneuvers. We further summarize insights offered by the game model by predicting that metrics such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) may intensify the secondary reasoning in cyber operations.</p></details> | 26 pages |

We prove that this is almost optimal: We give a family of $n$-node graphs for which every polynomial-size MIP formulation requires $\Omega(n/\log^2 n)$ integer variables. By a polyhedral reduction we obtain an analogous result for $n$-item knapsack problems. In both cases, this improves the previously known bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ by Cevallos, Weltge & Zenklusen (SODA 2018). To this end, we show that there exists a family of $n$-node graphs whose stable set polytopes satisfy the following: any $(1+\varepsilon/n)$-approximate extended formulation for these polytopes, for some constant $\varepsilon > 0$, has size $2^{\Omega(n/\log n)}$. Our proof extends and simplifies the information-theoretic methods due to G\"o\"os, Jain & Watson (FOCS 2016, SIAM J.

We introduce a continuous relaxation for the CKP, represented as a non-convex optimization problem, which we call the non-convex relaxation. A comparative study shows that the non-convex relaxation provides an upper bound for the CKP, at least as tight as those obtained from other continuous relaxations for the CKP. Furthermore, the quality of the obtained upper bound is guaranteed to be at most twice the optimal objective value of the CKP. Despite its non-convex nature, we show that the non-convex relaxation can be solved in polynomial time. Subsequently, we proposed a polynomial-time 1/2-approximation algorithm for the CKP based on this relaxation, providing a lower bound for the CKP. Computational test results demonstrate that the non-convex relaxation and the proposed approximation algorithm yields tight lower and upper bounds for the CKP within a short computation time, ensuring the quality of the obtained bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating the Geometric Knapsack Problem in Near-Linear Time and Dynamically](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00536v1)** | 2024-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important goal in algorithm design is determining the best running time for solving a problem (approximately). For some problems, we know the optimal running time, assuming certain conditional lower bounds. In this work, we study the $d$-dimensional geometric knapsack problem where we are far from this level of understanding. We are given a set of weighted d-dimensional geometric items like squares, rectangles, or hypercubes and a knapsack which is a square or a (hyper-)cube. We want to select a subset of items that fit non-overlappingly inside the knapsack, maximizing the total profit of the packed items. We make a significant step towards determining the best running time for solving these problems approximately by presenting approximation algorithms with near-linear running times for any constant dimension d and any constant parameter $\epsilon$. For (hyper)-cubes, we present a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm whose running time drastically improves upon the known $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm which has a running time where the exponent of n depends exponentially on $1/\epsilon$ and $d$. Moreover, we present a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for rectangles in the setting without rotations and a $(17/9+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm if we allow rotations by 90 degrees. The best known polynomial time algorithms for these settings have approximation ratios of $17/9+\epsilon$ and $1.5+\epsilon$, respectively, and running times in which the exponent of n depends exponentially on $1/\epsilon$. We also give dynamic algorithms with polylogarithmic query and update times and the same approximation guarantees as the algorithms above. Key to our results is a new family of structured packings which we call easily guessable packings. They are flexible enough to guarantee profitable solutions and structured enough so that we can compute these solutions quickly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Removable Online Knapsack and Advice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01867v2)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the knapsack problem, we are given a knapsack of some capacity and a set of items, each with a size and a value. The goal is to pack a selection of these items fitting the knapsack that maximizes the total value. The online version of this problem reveals the items one by one. For each item, the algorithm must decide immediately whether to pack it or not. We consider a natural variant of this problem, coined removable online knapsack. It differs from the classical variant by allowing the removal of packed items. Repacking is impossible, however: Once an item is removed, it is gone for good. We analyze the advice complexity of this problem. It measures how many advice bits an omniscient oracle needs to provide for an online algorithm to reach any given competitive ratio, which is, understood in its strict sense, just the approximation factor. We show that the competitive ratio jumps from unbounded without advice to near-optimal with just constantly many advice bits, a behavior unique among all problems examined so far. We also examine algorithms with barely any advice, for example just a single bit, and analyze the special case of the proportional knapsack problem, where an item's size always equals its value. We show that advice algorithms have various concrete applications and that lower bounds on the advice complexity of any problem are exceptionally strong. Our results improve some of the best known lower bounds on the competitive ratio for randomized algorithms and even for deterministic deterministic algorithms in established models such as knapsack with a resource buffer and various problems with multiple knapsacks. The seminal paper introducing knapsack with removability proposed such a problem for which we can even establish a one-to-one correspondence with the advice model; this paper therefore also provides a comprehensive analysis for this neglected problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knapsack with Small Items in Near-Quadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03075v3)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Knapsack problem is one of the most fundamental NP-complete problems at the intersection of computer science, optimization, and operations research. A recent line of research worked towards understanding the complexity of pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for Knapsack parameterized by the maximum item weight $w_{\mathrm{max}}$ and the number of items $n$. A conditional lower bound rules out that Knapsack can be solved in time $O((n+w_{\mathrm{max}})^{2-\delta})$ for any $\delta > 0$ [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki, Wlodarczyk'17, K\"unnemann, Paturi, Schneider'17]. This raised the question whether Knapsack can be solved in time $\tilde O((n+w_{\mathrm{max}})^2)$. This was open both for 0-1-Knapsack (where each item can be picked at most once) and Bounded Knapsack (where each item comes with a multiplicity). The quest of resolving this question lead to algorithms that solve Bounded Knapsack in time $\tilde O(n^3 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ [Tamir'09], $\tilde O(n^2 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ and $\tilde O(n w_{\mathrm{max}}^3)$ [Bateni, Hajiaghayi, Seddighin, Stein'18], $O(n^2 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ and $\tilde O(n w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ [Eisenbrand and Weismantel'18], $O(n + w_{\mathrm{max}}^3)$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki'21], and very recently $\tilde O(n + w_{\mathrm{max}}^{12/5})$ [Chen, Lian, Mao, Zhang'23]. In this paper we resolve this question by designing an algorithm for Bounded Knapsack with running time $\tilde O(n + w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$, which is conditionally near-optimal. This resolves the question both for the classic 0-1-Knapsack problem and for the Bounded Knapsack problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, accepted at STOC'24</p></details> |

The model features a single seller who has a fixed quantity of a perfectly divisible item. Impatient buyers with a piece-wise linear utility function arrive randomly and they report the two-dimensional private information: marginal value and demanded quantity. We derive a revenue-maximizing dynamic mechanism in a finite discrete time framework that satisfies incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and feasibility conditions. It is achieved by characterizing buyers' utility and deriving the Bellman equation. Moreover, we propose the essential penalty scheme for incentive compatibility, as well as the allocation and payment policies. Lastly, we propose algorithms to approximate the optimal policy, based on the Monte Carlo simulation-based regression method and reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figures, presented in AAAI 38th conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Cardinality-Constrained Continuous Knapsack Problem with Concave Piecewise-Linear Utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03781v2)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an extension of the cardinality-constrained knapsack problem wherein each item has a concave piecewise linear utility structure (CCKP), which is motivated by applications such as resource management problems in monitoring and surveillance tasks. Our main contributions are combinatorial algorithms for the offline CCKP and an online version of the CCKP. For the offline problem, we present a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and show that it can be cast as the maximization of a submodular function with cardinality constraints; the latter property allows us to derive a greedy $(1 - \frac{1}{e})$-approximation algorithm. For the online CCKP in the random order model, we derive a $\frac{10.427}{\alpha}$-competitive algorithm based on $\alpha$-approximation algorithms for the offline CCKP; moreover, we derive stronger guarantees for the cases wherein the cardinality capacity is very small or relatively large. Finally, we investigate the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms in numerical experiments.</p></details> | 34 pages, 3 figures |

That is, we assume that there exists a graph structure on the set of items of knapsack and the solution also needs to satisfy certain graph theoretic properties on top of knapsack constraints. In particular, we need to compute in the connected knapsack problem a connected subset of items which has maximum value subject to the size of knapsack constraint. We show that this problem is strongly NP-complete even for graphs of maximum degree four and NP-complete even for star graphs. On the other hand, we develop an algorithm running in time $O\left(2^{tw\log tw}\cdot\text{poly}(\min\{s^2,d^2\})\right)$ where $tw,s,d$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, size, and target value of the knapsack. We further exhibit a $(1-\epsilon)$ factor approximation algorithm running in time $O\left(2^{tw\log tw}\cdot\text{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\right)$ for every $\epsilon>0$. We show similar results for several other graph theoretic properties, namely path and shortest-path under the problem names path-knapsack and shortestpath-knapsack. Our results seems to indicate that connected-knapsack is computationally hardest followed by path-knapsack and shortestpath-knapsack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in LATIN 2024</p></details> |
| **[Securing Neural Networks with Knapsack Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10442v2)** | 2023-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLaaS Service Providers (SPs) holding a Neural Network would like to keep the Neural Network weights secret. On the other hand, users wish to utilize the SPs' Neural Network for inference without revealing their data. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) offers a solution to achieve this. Computations in MPC involve communication, as the parties send data back and forth. Non-linear operations are usually the main bottleneck requiring the bulk of communication bandwidth. In this paper, we focus on ResNets, which serve as the backbone for many Computer Vision tasks, and we aim to reduce their non-linear components, specifically, the number of ReLUs. Our key insight is that spatially close pixels exhibit correlated ReLU responses. Building on this insight, we replace the per-pixel ReLU operation with a ReLU operation per patch. We term this approach 'Block-ReLU'. Since different layers in a Neural Network correspond to different feature hierarchies, it makes sense to allow patch-size flexibility for the various layers of the Neural Network. We devise an algorithm to choose the optimal set of patch sizes through a novel reduction of the problem to the Knapsack Problem. We demonstrate our approach in the semi-honest secure 3-party setting for four problems: Classifying ImageNet using ResNet50 backbone, classifying CIFAR100 using ResNet18 backbone, Semantic Segmentation of ADE20K using MobileNetV2 backbone, and Semantic Segmentation of Pascal VOC 2012 using ResNet50 backbone. Our approach achieves competitive performance compared to a handful of competitors. Our source code is publicly available: https://github.com/yg320/secure_inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chance-Constrained Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem: Model, Algorithms, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14690v2)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Motivated by several significant real-world applications, this work investigates a novel variant of MCKP called chance-constrained multiple-choice knapsack problem (CCMCKP), where the item weights are random variables. In particular, we focus on the practical scenario of CCMCKP, where the probability distributions of random weights are unknown but only sample data is available. We first present the problem formulation of CCMCKP and then establish two benchmark sets. The first set contains synthetic instances and the second set is devised to simulate a real-world application scenario of a certain telecommunication company. To solve CCMCKP, we propose a data-driven adaptive local search (DDALS) algorithm. The main novelty of DDALS lies in its data-driven solution evaluation approach that can effectively handle unknown probability distributions of item weights. Moreover, in cases with unknown distributions, high intensity of chance constraints, limited amount of sample data and large-scale problems, it still exhibits good performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DDALS over other baselines on the two benchmarks. Additionally, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component of the algorithm. Finally, DDALS can serve as the baseline for future research, and the benchmark sets are open-sourced to further promote research on this challenging problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Bilevel Knapsack Problem using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13436v3)** | 2023-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bilevel Optimization Problem is a hierarchical optimization problem with two agents, a leader and a follower. The leader make their own decisions first, and the followers make the best choices accordingly. The leader knows the information of the followers, and the goal of the problem is to find the optimal solution by considering the reactions of the followers from the leader's point of view. For the Bilevel Optimization Problem, there are no general and efficient algorithms or commercial solvers to get an optimal solution, and it is very difficult to get a good solution even for a simple problem. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach using Graph Neural Networks to solve the bilevel knapsack problem. We train the model to predict the leader's solution and use it to transform the hierarchical optimization problem into a single-level optimization problem to get the solution. Our model found the feasible solution that was about 500 times faster than the exact algorithm with $1.7\%$ optimal gap. Also, our model performed well on problems of different size from the size it was trained on.</p></details> | 27 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Approximating Solutions to the Knapsack Problem using the Lagrangian Dual Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03413v1)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Knapsack Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimisation. Solving these problems may be computationally expensive. Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of deep learning methods to approximate the solutions to such problems. A core problem is how to enforce or encourage constraint satisfaction in predicted solutions. A promising approach for predicting solutions to constrained optimisation problems is the Lagrangian Dual Framework which builds on the method of Lagrangian Relaxation. In this paper we develop neural network models to approximate Knapsack Problem solutions using the Lagrangian Dual Framework while improving constraint satisfaction. We explore the problems of output interpretation and model selection within this context. Experimental results show strong constraint satisfaction with a minor reduction of optimality as compared to a baseline neural network which does not explicitly model the constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster Algorithms for Bounded Knapsack and Bounded Subset Sum Via Fine-Grained Proximity Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12582v2)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for Bounded Knapsack and Bounded Subset Sum. Recent years have seen a growing interest in settling their fine-grained complexity with respect to various parameters. For Bounded Knapsack, the number of items $n$ and the maximum item weight $w_{\max}$ are two of the most natural parameters that have been studied extensively in the literature. The previous best running time in terms of $n$ and $w_{\max}$ is $O(n + w^3_{\max})$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki '21]. There is a conditional lower bound of $O((n + w_{\max})^{2-o(1)})$ based on $(\min,+)$-convolution hypothesis [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki, Wlodarczyk '17]. We narrow the gap significantly by proposing a $\tilde{O}(n + w^{12/5}_{\max})$-time algorithm. Note that in the regime where $w_{\max} \approx n$, our algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{12/5})$ time, while all the previous algorithms require $\Omega(n^3)$ time in the worst case. For Bounded Subset Sum, we give two algorithms running in $\tilde{O}(nw_{\max})$ and $\tilde{O}(n + w^{3/2}_{\max})$ time, respectively. These results match the currently best running time for 0-1 Subset Sum. Prior to our work, the best running times (in terms of $n$ and $w_{\max}$) for Bounded Subset Sum is $\tilde{O}(n + w^{5/3}_{\max})$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki '21] and $\tilde{O}(n + \mu_{\max}^{1/2}w_{\max}^{3/2})$ [implied by Bringmann '19 and Bringmann, Wellnitz '21], where $\mu_{\max}$ refers to the maximum multiplicity of item weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SODA2024</p></details> |
| **[High-dimensional Linear Bandits with Knapsacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01327v1)** | 2023-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the contextual bandits with knapsack (CBwK) problem under the high-dimensional setting where the dimension of the feature is large. The reward of pulling each arm equals the multiplication of a sparse high-dimensional weight vector and the feature of the current arrival, with additional random noise. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit this sparsity structure to achieve improved regret for the CBwK problem. To this end, we first develop an online variant of the hard thresholding algorithm that performs the sparse estimation in an online manner. We further combine our online estimator with a primal-dual framework, where we assign a dual variable to each knapsack constraint and utilize an online learning algorithm to update the dual variable, thereby controlling the consumption of the knapsack capacity. We show that this integrated approach allows us to achieve a sublinear regret that depends logarithmically on the feature dimension, thus improving the polynomial dependency established in the previous literature. We also apply our framework to the high-dimension contextual bandit problem without the knapsack constraint and achieve optimal regret in both the data-poor regime and the data-rich regime. We finally conduct numerical experiments to show the efficient empirical performance of our algorithms under the high dimensional setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing The Knapsack Challenge Through Cultural Algorithm Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03324v1)** | 2023-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "0-1 knapsack problem" stands as a classical combinatorial optimization conundrum, necessitating the selection of a subset of items from a given set. Each item possesses inherent values and weights, and the primary objective is to formulate a selection strategy that maximizes the total value while adhering to a predefined capacity constraint. In this research paper, we introduce a novel variant of Cultural Algorithms tailored specifically for solving 0-1 knapsack problems, a well-known combinatorial optimization challenge. Our proposed algorithm incorporates a belief space to refine the population and introduces two vital functions for dynamically adjusting the crossover and mutation rates during the evolutionary process. Through extensive experimentation, we provide compelling evidence of the algorithm's remarkable efficiency in consistently locating the global optimum, even in knapsack problems characterized by high dimensions and intricate constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Total-Cost Constraints in Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks, with Application to Fairness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15807v2)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider contextual bandit problems with knapsacks [CBwK], a problem where at each round, a scalar reward is obtained and vector-valued costs are suffered. The learner aims to maximize the cumulative rewards while ensuring that the cumulative costs are lower than some predetermined cost constraints. We assume that contexts come from a continuous set, that costs can be signed, and that the expected reward and cost functions, while unknown, may be uniformly estimated -- a typical assumption in the literature. In this setting, total cost constraints had so far to be at least of order $T^{3/4}$, where $T$ is the number of rounds, and were even typically assumed to depend linearly on $T$. We are however motivated to use CBwK to impose a fairness constraint of equalized average costs between groups: the budget associated with the corresponding cost constraints should be as close as possible to the natural deviations, of order $\sqrt{T}$. To that end, we introduce a dual strategy based on projected-gradient-descent updates, that is able to deal with total-cost constraints of the order of $\sqrt{T}$ up to poly-logarithmic terms. This strategy is more direct and simpler than existing strategies in the literature. It relies on a careful, adaptive, tuning of the step size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Adaptive Non-Monotone Submodular Maximization Subject to a Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05014v3)** | 2023-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained submodular maximization problems encompass a wide variety of applications, including personalized recommendation, team formation, and revenue maximization via viral marketing. The massive instances occurring in modern day applications can render existing algorithms prohibitively slow, while frequently, those instances are also inherently stochastic. Focusing on these challenges, we revisit the classic problem of maximizing a (possibly non-monotone) submodular function subject to a knapsack constraint. We present a simple randomized greedy algorithm that achieves a $5.83$ approximation and runs in $O(n \log n)$ time, i.e., at least a factor $n$ faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms. The robustness of our approach allows us to further transfer it to a stochastic version of the problem. There, we obtain a 9-approximation to the best adaptive policy, which is the first constant approximation for non-monotone objectives. Experimental evaluation of our algorithms showcases their improved performance on real and synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Same ...</summary><p>Same as v1.

| **[Submodular Maximization subject to a Knapsack Constraint: Combinatorial Algorithms with Near-optimal Adaptive Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08327v2)** | 2023-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Submodular maximization is a classic algorithmic problem with multiple applications in data mining and machine learning; there, the growing need to deal with massive instances motivates the design of algorithms balancing the quality of the solution with applicability. For the latter, an important measure is the adaptive complexity, which captures the number of sequential rounds of parallel computation needed by an algorithm to terminate. In this work we obtain the first constant factor approximation algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization subject to a knapsack constraint with near-optimal $O(\log n)$ adaptive complexity. Low adaptivity by itself, however, is not enough: a crucial feature to account for is represented by the total number of function evaluations (or value queries). Our algorithm asks $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ value queries, but can be modified to run with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ instead, while retaining a low adaptive complexity of $O(\log^2n)$. Besides the above improvement in adaptivity, this is also the first combinatorial approach with sublinear adaptive complexity for the problem and yields algorithms comparable to the state-of-the-art even for the special cases of cardinality constraints or monotone objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version addresses a gap in the probabilistic analysis of the approximation guarantees in the previous version of this work.

Recently, In-Context Learning demonstrated significant performance advances for reasoning tasks. In this paradigm, a large language model performs predictions based on a small set of supporting exemplars. The performance of In-Context Learning depends heavily on the selection procedure of the supporting exemplars, particularly in the case of HybridQA, where considering the diversity of reasoning chains and the large size of the hybrid contexts becomes crucial. In this work, we present Selection of ExEmplars for hybrid Reasoning (SEER), a novel method for selecting a set of exemplars that is both representative and diverse. The key novelty of SEER is that it formulates exemplar selection as a Knapsack Integer Linear Program. The Knapsack framework provides the flexibility to incorporate diversity constraints that prioritize exemplars with desirable attributes, and capacity constraints that ensure that the prompt size respects the provided capacity budgets. The effectiveness of SEER is demonstrated on FinQA and TAT-QA, two real-world benchmarks for HybridQA, where it outperforms previous exemplar selection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready revision for EMNLP 2023 main conference.

| **[No Polynomial Kernels for Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12593v2)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on kernelization algorithms for the fundamental Knapsack problem. A kernelization algorithm (or kernel) is a polynomial-time reduction from a problem onto itself, where the output size is bounded by a function of some problem-specific parameter. Such algorithms provide a theoretical model for data reduction and preprocessing and are central in the area of parameterized complexity. In this way, a kernel for Knapsack for some parameter $k$ reduces any instance of Knapsack to an equivalent instance of size at most $f(k)$ in polynomial time, for some computable function $f(\cdot)$. When $f(k)=k^{O(1)}$ then we call such a reduction a polynomial kernel. Our study focuses on two natural parameters for Knapsack: The number of different item weights $w_{\#}$, and the number of different item profits $p_{\#}$. Our main technical contribution is a proof showing that Knapsack does not admit a polynomial kernel for any of these two parameters under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions. Our proof discovers an elaborate application of the standard kernelization lower bound framework, and develops along the way novel ideas that should be useful for other problems as well. We complement our lower bounds by showing the Knapsack admits a polynomial kernel for the combined parameter $w_{\#}+p_{\#}$.</p></details> |  |

In the basic setting of $k$-unit prophet inequalities, the well-known procedure of Alaei (2011) with its celebrated performance guarantee of $1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+3}}$ has found widespread adoption in mechanism design and general online allocation problems in online advertising, healthcare scheduling, and revenue management. Despite being commonly used to derive approximately-optimal algorithms for multi-resource allocation problems, the tightness of Alaei's guarantee has remained unknown. In this paper characterize the tight guarantee in Alaei's setting, which we show is in fact strictly greater than $1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+3}}$ for all $k>1$. We also consider the more general online stochastic knapsack problem where each individual allocation can consume an arbitrary fraction of the initial capacity. Here we introduce a new ``best-fit'' procedure with a performance guarantee of $\frac{1}{3+e^{-2}}\approx0.319$, which we also show is tight with respect to the standard LP relaxation. This improves the previously best-known guarantee of 0.2 for online knapsack. Our analysis differs from existing ones by eschewing the need to split items into ``large'' or ``small'' based on capacity consumption, using instead an invariant for the overall utilization on different sample paths. Finally, we refine our technique for the unit-density special case of knapsack, and improve the guarantee from 0.321 to 0.3557 in the multi-resource appointment scheduling application of Stein et al. (2020).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the full version of the SODA 2022 paper</p></details> |

This model was introduced by Rubinstein, Schramm and Weinberg [ITCS'18] and its investigation has so far focused on the number of queries needed to solve optimization problems, such as global minimum cut. We turn attention to the round complexity of cut-query algorithms, and show that several classical problems can be solved in this model with only a constant number of rounds. Our main results are algorithms for finding a minimum cut in a graph, that offer different tradeoffs between round complexity and query complexity, where $n=|V|$ and $\delta(G)$ denotes the minimum degree of $G$: (i) $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ cut queries in two rounds in unweighted graphs; (ii) $\tilde{O}(rn^{1+1/r}/\delta(G)^{1/r})$ queries in $2r+1$ rounds for any integer $r\ge 1$ again in unweighted graphs; and (iii) $\tilde{O}(rn^{1+(1+\log_n W)/r})$ queries in $4r+3$ rounds for any $r\ge1$ in weighted graphs. We also provide algorithms that find a minimum $(s,t)$-cut and approximate the maximum cut in a few rounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating the Held-Karp Bound for Metric TSP in Nearly Linear Work and Polylogarithmic Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14745v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a nearly linear work parallel algorithm for approximating the Held-Karp bound for the Metric TSP problem. Given an edge-weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ on $m$ edges and $\epsilon>0$, it returns a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the Held-Karp bound with high probability, in $\tilde{O}(m/\epsilon^4)$ work and $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ depth. While a nearly linear time sequential algorithm was known for almost a decade (Chekuri and Quanrud'17), it was not known how to simultaneously achieve nearly linear work alongside polylogarithmic depth. Using a reduction by Chalermsook et al.'22, we also give a parallel algorithm for computing a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate fractional solution to the $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph (kECSS) problem, with similar complexity. To obtain these results, we introduce a notion of core-sequences for the parallel Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) framework (Luby-Nisan'93, Young'01). For the Metric TSP and kECSS problems, core-sequences enable us to exploit the structure of approximate minimum cuts to reduce the cost per iteration and/or the number of iterations. The acceleration technique via core-sequences is generic and of independent interest. In particular, it improves the best-known iteration complexity of MWU algorithms for packing/covering LPs from $poly(\log nnz(A))$ to polylogarithmic in the product of cardinalities of the core-sequence sets, where $A$ is the constraint matrix of the LP. For certain implicitly defined LPs such as the kECSS LP, this yields an exponential improvement in depth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the O(mn)-Time Barrier for Vertex-Weighted Global Minimum Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11926v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem: given an undirected vertex-weighted graph $G$, compute a minimum-weight subset of its vertices whose removal disconnects $G$. The problem is closely related to Global Minimum Edge-Cut, where the weights are on the graph edges instead of vertices, and the goal is to compute a minimum-weight subset of edges whose removal disconnects the graph. Global Minimum Cut is one of the most basic and extensively studied problems in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. While an almost-linear time algorithm was known for the edge version of the problem for awhile (Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), the fastest previous algorithm for the vertex version (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000) achieves a running time of $\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. For the special case of unit vertex weights, this bound was broken only recently (Li {et al.}, STOC 2021); their result, combined with the recent breakthrough almost-linear time algorithm for Maximum $s$-$t$ Flow (Chen {et al.}, FOCS 2022, van den Brand {et al.}, FOCS 2023), yields an almost-linear time algorithm for Global Minimum Vertex-Cut with unit vertex weights. In this paper we break the $28$ years old bound of Henzinger {et al.} for the general weighted Global Minimum Vertex-Cut, by providing a randomized algorithm for the problem with running time $O(\min\{mn^{0.99+o(1)},m^{1.5+o(1)}\})$.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for the Design of Efficient Diversification Algorithms to NP-Hard Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12261v4)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been considerable recent interest in computing a diverse collection of solutions to a given optimization problem, both in the AI and theory communities. Given a classical optimization problem $\Pi$ (e.g., spanning tree, minimum cuts, maximum matching, minimum vertex cover) with input size $n$ and an integer $k\geq 1$, the goal is to generate a collection of $k$ maximally diverse solutions to $\Pi$. This diverse-X paradigm not only allows the user to generate very different solutions, but also helps make systems more secure and robust by handling uncertainty, and achieve energy efficiency. For problems $\Pi$ in P (such as spanning tree and minimum cut), there are efficient $\text{poly}(n,k)$ approximation algorithms available for the diverse variants [Hanaka et al. AAAI 2021, 2022, 2023, Gao et al. LATIN 2022, de Berg et al. ISAAC 2023]. In contrast, only FPT algorithms are known for NP-hard problems such as vertex covers and independent sets [Baste et al. IJCAI 2020, Eiben et al. SODA 2024, Misra et al. ISAAC 2024, Austrin et al. ICALP 2025], but in the worst case, these algorithms run in time $\exp((kn)^c)$ for some $c>0$. In this work, we address this gap and give $\text{poly}(n,k)$ or $f(k)\text{poly}(n)$ time approximation algorithms for diversification variants of several NP-hard problems such as knapsack, maximum weight independent sets (MWIS) and minimum vertex covers in planar graphs, geometric (rectangle) knapsack, enclosing points by polygon, and MWIS in unit-disk-graphs of points in convex position. Our results are achieved by developing a general framework and applying it to problems with textbook dynamic-programming algorithms to find one solution.</p></details> |  |

While spectral clustering methods for undirected graphs are well-established and guided by a minimum cut optimization consensus, their extension to directed graphs remains relatively underexplored due to the additional complexity introduced by edge directions. In this paper, we leverage statistical inference on stochastic block models to guide the development of a spectral clustering algorithm for directed graphs. Specifically, we study the maximum likelihood estimation under a widely used directed stochastic block model, and derive a global objective function that aligns with the underlying community structure. We further establish a theoretical upper bound on the misclustering error of its spectral relaxation, and based on this relaxation, introduce a novel, self-adaptive spectral clustering method for directed graphs. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Effective Flow-based Method for Positive-Unlabeled Learning: 2-HNC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08212v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scenarios of binary classification, only positive instances are provided in the training data, leaving the rest of the data unlabeled. This setup, known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, is addressed here with a network flow-based method which utilizes pairwise similarities between samples. The method we propose here, 2-HNC, leverages Hochbaum's Normalized Cut (HNC) and the set of solutions it provides by solving a parametric minimum cut problem. The set of solutions, that are nested partitions of the samples into two sets, correspond to varying tradeoff values between the two goals: high intra-similarity inside the sets and low inter-similarity between the two sets. This nested sequence is utilized here to deliver a ranking of unlabeled samples by their likelihood of being negative. Building on this insight, our method, 2-HNC, proceeds in two stages. The first stage generates this ranking without assuming any negative labels, using a problem formulation that is constrained only on positive labeled samples. The second stage augments the positive set with likely-negative samples and recomputes the classification. The final label prediction selects among all generated partitions in both stages, the one that delivers a positive class proportion, closest to a prior estimate of this quantity, which is assumed to be given. Extensive experiments across synthetic and real datasets show that 2-HNC yields strong performance and often surpasses existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

This fundamental problem arises in network reliability, VLSI design, and community detection. We present HeiCut, a scalable algorithm for computing near-optimal minimum cuts in both unweighted and weighted hypergraphs. HeiCut aggressively reduces the hypergraph size through a sequence of provably exact reductions that preserve the minimum cut, along with an optional heuristic contraction based on label propagation. It then solves a relaxed Binary Integer Linear Program (BIP) on the reduced hypergraph to compute a near-optimal minimum cut. Our extensive evaluation on over 500 real-world hypergraphs shows that HeiCut computes the exact minimum cut in over 85% of instances using our exact reductions alone, and offers the best solution quality across all instances. It solves over twice as many instances as the state-of-the-art within set computational limits, and is up to five orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Case for External Graph Sketching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17563v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms in the data stream model use $O(polylog(N))$ space to compute some property of an input of size $N$, and many of these algorithms are implemented and used in practice. However, sketching algorithms in the graph semi-streaming model use $O(V polylog(V))$ space for a $V$-vertex graph, and the fact that implementations of these algorithms are not used in the academic literature or in industrial applications may be because this space requirement is too large for RAM on today's hardware. In this paper we introduce the external semi-streaming model, which addresses the aspects of the semi-streaming model that limit its practical impact. In this model, the input is in the form of a stream and $O(V polylog(V))$ space is available, but most of that space is accessible only via block I/O operations as in the external memory model. The goal in the external semi-streaming model is to simultaneously achieve small space and low I/O cost. We present a general transformation from any vertex-based sketch algorithm to one which has a low sketching cost in the new model. We prove that this automatic transformation is tight or nearly (up to a $O(\log(V))$ factor) tight via an I/O lower bound for the task of sketching the input stream. Using this transformation and other techniques, we present external semi-streaming algorithms for connectivity, bipartiteness testing, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximating MST weight, testing k-edge connectivity, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximating the minimum cut of a graph, computing $\epsilon$-cut sparsifiers, and approximating the density of the densest subgraph. These algorithms all use $O(V poly(\log(V), \epsilon^{-1},k)$ space. For many of these problems, our external semi-streaming algorithms outperform the state of the art algorithms in both the sketching and external-memory models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version for paper to appear in ACDA proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Multicut Problems in Embedded Graphs: The Dependency of Complexity on the Demand Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11086v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Multicut problem asks for a minimum cut separating certain pairs of vertices: formally, given a graph $G$ and demand graph $H$ on a set $T\subseteq V(G)$ of terminals, the task is to find a minimum-weight set $C$ of edges of $G$ such that whenever two vertices of $T$ are adjacent in $H$, they are in different components of $G\setminus C$. Colin de Verdi\`{e}re [Algorithmica, 2017] showed that Multicut with $t$ terminals on a graph $G$ of genus $g$ can be solved in time $f(t,g)n^{O(\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$. Cohen-Addad et al. [JACM, 2021] proved a matching lower bound showing that the exponent of $n$ is essentially best possible (for every fixed value of $t$ and $g$), even in the special case of Multiway Cut, where the demand graph $H$ is a complete graph. However, this lower bound tells us nothing about other special cases of Multicut such as Group 3-Terminal Cut (where three groups of terminals need to be separated from each other). We show that if the demand pattern is, in some sense, close to being a complete bipartite graph, then Multicut can be solved faster than $f(t,g)n^{O(\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$, and furthermore this is the only property that allows such an improvement. Formally, for a class $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$ is the special case where the demand graph $H$ is in $\mathcal{H}$. For every fixed class $\mathcal{H}$ (satisfying some mild closure property), fixed $g$, and fixed $t$, our main result gives tight upper and lower bounds on the exponent of $n$ in algorithms solving Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$.</p></details> |  |
