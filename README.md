| **[Message Recovery Attack in NTRU via Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26003v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present paper, we introduce a message-recovery attack based on the Modular Knapsack Problem, applicable to all variants of the NTRU-HPS cryptosystem. Assuming that a fraction $\epsilon$ of the coefficients of the message ${\bf{m}}\in\{-1,0,1\}^N$ and of the nonce vector ${\bf r}\in\{-1,0,1\}^N$ are known in advance at random positions, we reduce message decryption to finding a short vector in a lattice that encodes an instance of a modular knapsack system. This allows us to address a key question: how much information about ${\bf m}$, or about the pair $({\bf m},{\bf r})$, is required before recovery becomes feasible? A FLATTER reduction successfully recovers the message, in practice when $\epsilon\approx 0.45$. Our implementation finds ${\bf m}$ within a few minutes on a commodity desktop.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Extensible Bin Packing and Revisiting the Convex Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23765v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a robust extensible bin packing problem with budgeted uncertainty, under a budgeted uncertainty model where item sizes are defined to lie in the intersection of a box with a one-norm ball. We propose a scenario generation algorithm for this problem, which alternates between solving a master robust bin-packing problem with a finite uncertainty set and solving a separation problem. We first show that the separation is strongly NP-hard given solutions to the continuous relaxation of the master problem. Then, focusing on the separation problem for the integer master problem, we show that this problem becomes a special case of the continuous convex knapsack problem, which is known to be weakly NP-hard. Next, we prove that our special case when each of the functions is piecewise linear, having only two pieces, remains NP-hard. We develop a pseudo-polynomial dynamic program (DP) and a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for our special case whose running times match those of a binary knapsack FPTAS. Finally, our computational study shows that the DP can be significantly more efficient in practice compared with solving the problem with specially ordered set (SOS) constraints using advanced mixed-integer (MIP) solvers. Our experiments also demonstrate the application of our separation problem method to solving the robust extensible bin packing problem, including the evaluation of deferring the exact solution of the master problem, separating based on approximate master solutions in intermediate iterations. Finally, a case-study, based on real elective surgery data, demonstrates the potential advantage of our model compared with the actual schedule and optimal nominal schedules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving 0-1 Integer Programs with Unknown Knapsack Constraints Using Membership Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14090v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with unknown knapsack constraints using a membership oracle for each unknown constraint such that, given a solution, the oracle determines whether the constraint is satisfied or not with absolute certainty. The goal of the decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning for binary classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we devise a framework to solve the problem by learning and exploiting surrogate linear constraints. The framework includes training linear separators on the labeled points and selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active learning literature, a natural choice would be SVM as a linear classifier and the information-based sampling strategy known as simple margin, for each unknown constraint. We improve on both sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on classical problems and variants inspired by realistic applications to show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence the quality of the results in terms of several metrics including objective value, dual bound and running time.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Complexity of Recognizing Facets for the Knapsack Polytope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03311v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexity class DP is the class of all languages that are the intersection of a language in NP and a language in coNP. It was conjectured that recognizing a facet for the knapsack polytope is DP-complete. We provide a positive answer to this conjecture. Moreover, despite the \DP-hardness of the recognition problem, we give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if an inequality with a fixed number of distinct coefficients defines a facet of a knapsack polytope.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Exact Solver for Submodular Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16149v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of maximizing a monotone increasing submodular function over a set of weighted elements subject to a knapsack constraint. Although this problem is NP-hard, many applications require exact solutions, as approximate solutions are often insufficient in practice. To address this need, we propose an exact branch-and-bound algorithm tailored for the submodular knapsack problem and introduce several acceleration techniques to enhance its efficiency. We evaluate these techniques on artificial instances of three benchmark problems as well as on instances derived from real-world data. We compare the proposed solver with two solvers by Sakaue and Ishihata (2018), which currently achieve the strongest performance reported in the literature, as well as with a branch-and-cut algorithm implemented using Gurobi that solves a binary linear reformulation of the submodular knapsack problem, demonstrating that our methods are highly successful.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Composition of Agents: A Knapsack Approach for Agentic Component Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16499v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25849v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning, where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions. However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and "cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch", our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stealing From the Dragon's Hoard: Online Unbounded Knapsack With Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19914v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Online Unbounded Knapsack Problem with Removal, a variation of the well-known Online Knapsack Problem. Items, each with a weight and value, arrive online and an algorithm must decide on whether or not to pack them into a knapsack with a fixed weight limit. An item may be packed an arbitrary number of times and items may be removed from the knapsack at any time without cost. The goal is to maximize the total value of items packed, while respecting a weight limit. We show that this is one of the very few natural online knapsack variants that allow for competitive deterministic algorithms in the general setting, by providing an algorithm with competitivity 1.6911. We complement this with a lower bound of 1.5877. We also analyze the proportional setting, where the weight and value of any single item agree, and show that deterministic algorithms can be exactly 3/2-competitive. Lastly, we give lower and upper bounds of 6/5 and 4/3 on the competitivity of randomized algorithms in this setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Network Revenue Management and Bandits with Knapsacks under Limited Switches](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01067v5)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the impact of limited switches on resource-constrained dynamic pricing with demand learning. We focus on the classical price-based blind network revenue management problem and extend our results to the bandits with knapsacks problem. In both settings, a decision maker faces stochastic and distributionally unknown demand, and must allocate finite initial inventory across multiple resources over time. In addition to standard resource constraints, we impose a switching constraint that limits the number of action changes over the time horizon. We establish matching upper and lower bounds on the optimal regret and develop computationally efficient limited-switch algorithms that achieve it. We show that the optimal regret rate is fully characterized by a piecewise-constant function of the switching budget, which further depends on the number of resource constraints. Our results highlight the fundamental role of resource constraints in shaping the statistical complexity of online learning under limited switches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithms maintain strong cumulative reward performance while significantly reducing the number of switches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knapsack Contracts and the Importance of Return-on-Investment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05956v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate the Knapsack Contracts problem -- a strategic version of the classic Stochastic Knapsack problem, which builds upon the inherent randomness shared by stochastic optimization and contract design. In this problem, the principal incentivizes agents to perform jobs with stochastic processing times, the realization of which depends on the agents' efforts. Algorithmically, we show that Knapsack Contracts can be viewed as Stochastic Knapsack with costs and multi-choice, features that introduce significant new challenges. We identify a crucial and economically meaningful parameter -- the Return on Investment (ROI) value. We show that the Inverse of ROI (or IOR for short) precisely characterizes the extent to which the approximation guarantees for Stochastic Knapsack extend to its strategic counterpart. For IOR of $\alpha$, we develop an algorithm that finds an $O(\alpha)$-approximation policy that does not rely on adaptivity. We establish matching $\Omega(\alpha)$ lower bounds, both on the adaptivity gap, and on what can be achieved without full distributional knowledge of the processing times. Taken together, our results show that IOR is fundamental to understanding the complexity and approximability of Knapsack Contracts, and bounding it is both necessary and sufficient for achieving non-trivial approximation guarantees. Our results highlight the computational challenges arising when stochasticity in optimization problems is controlled by strategic effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy stable finite difference methods via entropy correction artificial viscosity and knapsack limiting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21226v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy inequality. In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2507.14488</p></details> |
| **[$(1-ε)$-Approximation of Knapsack in Nearly Quadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07004v4)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knapsack is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical computer science. In the $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation setting, although there is a fine-grained lower bound of $(n + 1 / \epsilon) ^ {2 - o(1)}$ based on the $(\min, +)$-convolution hypothesis ([K{\"u}nnemann, Paturi and Stefan Schneider, ICALP 2017] and [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki and Wlodarczyk, 2017]), the best algorithm is randomized and runs in $\tilde O\left(n + (\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{11/5}/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})}\right)$ time [Deng, Jin and Mao, SODA 2023], and it remains an important open problem whether an algorithm with a running time that matches the lower bound (up to a sub-polynomial factor) exists. We answer the question positively by showing a deterministic $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation scheme for knapsack that runs in $\tilde O(n + (1 / \epsilon) ^ {2})$ time. We first extend a known lemma in a recursive way to reduce the problem to $n \epsilon$-additive approximation for $n$ items with profits in $[1, 2)$. Then we give a simple efficient geometry-based algorithm for the reduced problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to STOC 2024; Revision note: expanded technical overview;</p></details> |
| **[Convolution and Knapsack in Higher Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16117v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Knapsack problem, one is given the task of packing a knapsack of a given size with items in order to gain a packing with a high profit value. An important connection to the $(\max,+)$-convolution problem has been established, where knapsack solutions can be combined by building the convolution of two sequences. This observation has been used in recent years to give conditional lower bounds but also parameterized algorithms. In this paper we carry these results into higher dimensions. We consider Knapsack where items are characterized by multiple properties -- given through a vector -- and a knapsack that has a capacity vector. The packing must not exceed any of the given capacity constraints. In order to show a similar sub-quadratic lower bound we consider a multidimensional version of $(\max, +)$-convolution. We then consider variants of this problem introduced by Cygan et al. and prove that they are all equivalent in terms of algorithms that allow for a running time sub-quadratic in the number of entries of the array. We develop a parameterized algorithm to solve higher dimensional Knapsack. The techniques we apply are inspired by an algorithm introduced by Axiotis and Tzamos. We will show that even for higher dimensional Knapsack, we can reduce the problem to convolution on one-dimensional, concave sequences, leading to an $\mathcal{O}(dn + dD \cdot \max\{\Pi_{i=1}^d{t_i}, t_{\max}\log t_{\max}\})$ algorithm, where $D$ is the number of different weight vectors, $t$ the capacity vector and $d$ is the dimension of the problem. Then, we use the techniques to improve the approach of Eisenbrand and Weismantel to obtain an algorithm for Integer Linear Programming with upper bounds with running time $\mathcal{O}(dn) + D \cdot \mathcal{O}(d \Delta)^{d(d+1)} + T_{\mathrm{LP}}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at WADS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Performance of the Extended Ising Machine for the Quadratic Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06909v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extended Ising machine (EIM) enhances conventional Ising models, which handle only binary quadratic forms by allowing constraints through real-valued dependent variables. We address the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP), hard to solve using Ising machines when formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). We demonstrated the EIM's superiority by comparing it with the conventional Ising model-based approach, a commercial exact solver, and a state-of-the-art heuristic solver for QKP.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[An Online Multi-dimensional Knapsack Approach for Slice Admission Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06468v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network Slicing has emerged as a powerful technique to enable cost-effective, multi-tenant communications and services over a shared physical mobile network infrastructure. One major challenge of service provisioning in slice-enabled networks is the uncertainty in the demand for the limited network resources that must be shared among existing slices and potentially new Network Slice Requests. In this paper, we consider admission control of Network Slice Requests in an online setting, with the goal of maximizing the long-term revenue received from admitted requests. We model the Slice Admission Control problem as an Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problem and present two reservation-based policies and their algorithms, which have a competitive performance for Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problems. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the performance of our online admission control method in terms of average revenue gained by the Infrastructure Provider, system resource utilization, and the ratio of accepted slice requests. We compare our approach with those of the online First Come First Serve greedy policy. The simulation's results prove that our proposed online policies increase revenues for Infrastructure Providers by up to 12.9 % while reducing the average resource consumption by up to 1.7% In particular, when the tenants' economic inequality increases, an Infrastructure Provider who adopts our proposed online admission policies gains higher revenues compared to an Infrastructure Provider who adopts First Come First Serve.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 20th Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)</p></details> |
| **[High-dimensional Linear Bandits with Knapsacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01327v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the contextual bandits with knapsack (CBwK) problem in a high-dimensional linear setting, where the feature dimension can be very large. Our goal is to harness sparsity to obtain sharper regret guarantees. To this end, we first develop an online variant of the hard thresholding algorithm that performs the sparse estimation in an online manner. We then embed this estimator in a primal-dual scheme: every knapsack constraint is paired with a dual variable, which is updated by an online learning rule to keep the cumulative resource consumption within budget. This integrated approach achieves a two-phase sub-linear regret that scales only logarithmically with the feature dimension, improving on the polynomial dependency reported in prior work. Furthermore, we show that either of the following structural assumptions is sufficient for a sharper regret bound of $\tilde{O}(s_{0} \sqrt{T})$: (i) a diverse-covariate condition; and (ii) a margin condition. When both conditions hold simultaneously, we can further control the regret to $O(s_{0}^{2} \log(dT)\log T)$ by a dual resolving scheme. As a by-product, applying our framework to high-dimensional contextual bandits without knapsack constraints recovers the optimal regret rates in both the data-poor and data-rich regimes. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the empirical efficiency of our algorithms in high-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy Stable Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods via Quadratic Knapsack Limiting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14488v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lin, Chan (High order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods through subcell limiting, 2024) enforces a cell entropy inequality for nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods by combining flux corrected transport (FCT)-type limiting and a knapsack solver, which determines optimal limiting coefficients that result in a semi-discrete cell entropy inequality while preserving nodal bounds. In this work, we provide a slight modification of this approach, where we utilize a quadratic knapsack problem instead of a standard linear knapsack problem. We prove that this quadratic knapsack problem can be reduced to efficient scalar root-finding. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed quadratic knapsack limiting strategy is efficient and results in a semi-discretization with improved regularity in time compared with linear knapsack limiting, while resulting in fewer adaptive timesteps in shock-type problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Branch-and-Bound for Submodular Function Maximization under Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11107v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The submodular knapsack problem (SKP), which seeks to maximize a submodular set function by selecting a subset of elements within a given budget, is an important discrete optimization problem. The majority of existing approaches to solving the SKP are approximation algorithms. However, in domains such as health-care facility location and risk management, the need for optimal solutions is still critical, necessitating the use of exact algorithms over approximation methods. In this paper, we present an optimal branch-and-bound approach, featuring a novel upper bound with a worst-case tightness guarantee and an efficient dual branching method to minimize repeat computations. Experiments in applications such as facility location, weighted coverage, influence maximization, and so on show that the algorithms that implement the new ideas are far more efficient than conventional methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Our approach relies on succinct, practical predictions -- single values or intervals estimating the minimum value of any item in an offline solution. Additionally, we propose a novel fractional-to-integral conversion procedure, offering new insights for online algorithm design.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 16 figures, Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Episodic Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks under Conversion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06859v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an online setting, where a decision maker (DM) interacts with contextual bandit-with-knapsack (BwK) instances in repeated episodes. These episodes start with different resource amounts, and the contexts' probability distributions are non-stationary in an episode. All episodes share the same latent conversion model, which governs the random outcome contingent upon a request's context and an allocation decision. Our model captures applications such as dynamic pricing on perishable resources with episodic replenishment, and first price auctions in repeated episodes with different starting budgets. We design an online algorithm that achieves a regret sub-linear in $T$, the number of episodes, assuming access to a \emph{confidence bound oracle} that achieves an $o(T)$-regret. Such an oracle is readily available from existing contextual bandit literature. We overcome the technical challenge with arbitrarily many possible contexts, which leads to a reinforcement learning problem with an unbounded state space. Our framework provides improved regret bounds in certain settings when the DM is provided with unlabeled feature data, which is novel to the contextual BwK literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dominating Set Knapsack: Profit Optimization on Dominating Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24032v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a large-scale network, we want to choose some influential nodes to make a profit by paying some cost within a limited budget so that we do not have to spend more budget on some nodes adjacent to the chosen nodes; our problem is the graph-theoretic representation of it. We define our problem Dominating Set Knapsack by attaching Knapsack Problem with Dominating Set on graphs. Each vertex is associated with a cost factor and a profit amount. We aim to choose some vertices within a fixed budget that gives maximum profit so that we do not need to choose their 1-hop neighbors. We show that the Dominating Set Knapsack problem is strongly NP-complete even when restricted to Bipartite graphs but weakly NP-complete for Star graphs. We present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for Trees in time $O(n\cdot min\{s^2, (\alpha(V))^2\})$. We show that Dominating Set Knapsack is very unlikely to be Fixed Parameter Tractable(FPT) by proving that it is in W[2]-hard parameterized by the solution size. We developed FPT algorithms with running time $O(4^{tw}\cdot n^{O(1)} \cdot min\{s^2, ((\alpha(V))^2\})$ and $O(2^{vck-1}\cdot n^{O(1)} \cdot min\{s^2,(\alpha(V))^2\})$, where $tw$ represents the treewidth of the given graph, $vck$ is the solution size of the Vertex Cover Knapsack, $s$ is the size of the knapsack and $\alpha(V)=\sum_{v\in V}\alpha(v)$. We obtained similar results for other variants k-Dominating Set Knapsack and Minimal Dominating Set Knapsack. We obtained similar results for other variants k-Dominating Set Knapsack and Minimal Dominating Set Knapsack.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Algorithms for Bandits with Knapsacks with Improved Regret and Time Complexities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04438v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed light on operations research.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[On the Complexity of Knapsack under Explorable Uncertainty: Hardness and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02657v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the knapsack problem under explorable uncertainty, we are given a knapsack instance with uncertain item profits. Instead of having access to the precise profits, we are only given uncertainty intervals that are guaranteed to contain the corresponding profits. The actual item profit can be obtained via a query. The goal of the problem is to adaptively query item profits until the revealed information suffices to compute an optimal (or approximate) solution to the underlying knapsack instance. Since queries are costly, the objective is to minimize the number of queries. In the offline variant of this problem, we assume knowledge of the precise profits and the task is to compute a query set of minimum cardinality that a third party without access to the profits could use to identify an optimal (or approximate) knapsack solution. We show that this offline variant is complete for the second-level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $\Sigma_2^p$-complete, and cannot be approximated within a non-trivial factor unless $\Sigma_2^p = \Delta_2^p$. Motivated by these strong hardness results, we consider a resource-augmented variant of the problem where the requirements on the query set computed by an algorithm are less strict than the requirements on the optimal solution we compare against. More precisely, a query set computed by the algorithm must reveal sufficient information to identify an approximate knapsack solution, while the optimal query set we compare against has to reveal sufficient information to identify an optimal solution. We show that this resource-augmented setting allows interesting non-trivial algorithmic results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unbounded knapsack problem and double partitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23499v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unbounded knapsack problem can be considered as a particular case of the double partition problem that asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of two linear Diophantine equations with integer coefficients.

This manuscript discusses a geometric interpretation of this method and its application to the knapsack problem.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Knapsack Optimization-based Schema Linking for LLM-based Text-to-SQL Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12911v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating SQLs from user queries is a long-standing challenge, where the accuracy of initial schema linking significantly impacts subsequent SQL generation performance. However, current schema linking models still struggle with missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial reason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to capture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking performance. Motivated by this, we propose enhanced schema linking metrics by introducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack optimization-based Schema Linking Approach (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking method designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while minimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical linking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and subsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking candidate space. In each linking process, it utilizes a knapsack optimization approach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited tolerance of potentially redundant ones. With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B achieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs, including deepseek-v3 with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method. Extensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can significantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA Text2SQL models by substituting their schema linking processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Efficient Knapsack Optimization Using Probabilistic Memristor Crossbars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04332v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained optimization underlies crucial societal problems (for instance, stock trading and bandwidth allocation), but is often computationally hard (complexity grows exponentially with problem size). The big-data era urgently demands low-latency and low-energy optimization at the edge, which cannot be handled by digital processors due to their non-parallel von Neumann architecture. Recent efforts using massively parallel hardware (such as memristor crossbars and quantum processors) employing annealing algorithms, while promising, have handled relatively easy and stable problems with sparse or binary representations (such as the max-cut or traveling salesman problems).However, most real-world applications embody three features, which are encoded in the knapsack problem, and cannot be handled by annealing algorithms - dense and non-binary representations, with destabilizing self-feedback. Here we demonstrate a post-digital-hardware-friendly randomized competitive Ising-inspired (RaCI) algorithm performing knapsack optimization, experimentally implemented on a foundry-manufactured CMOS-integrated probabilistic analog memristor crossbar. Our solution outperforms digital and quantum approaches by over 4 orders of magnitude in energy efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

These methods provide an exact equation which returns the optimal solution of the problems. As in other tensor network algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, the method is based on imaginary time evolution and the implementation of restrictions in the tensor network. In addition, we introduce the use of symmetries and the reutilization of intermediate calculations, reducing the computational complexity for both problems. To show the efficiency of our implementations, we carry out some performance experiments and compare the results with those obtained by other classical algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, extended version of the presented and published at the 1st International Conference on Quantum Software (IQSOFT)</p></details> |

We present an extension of DHR (abbreviated as EDHR), which reduces an instance of 0-1 KP to at most $n^i$ sub-instances for any positive integer $i$. In practice, $i$ can be set as needed. In particular, if we choose $i=1$ then EDHR is exactly DHR. Finally, computational experiments on randomly generated data instances demonstrate that EDHR substantially reduces the search tree size compared to CPLEX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Submodular Maximization over a Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12126v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider fairness in submodular maximization subject to a knapsack constraint, a fundamental problem with various applications in economics, machine learning, and data mining. In the model, we are given a set of ground elements, each associated with a weight and a color, and a monotone submodular function defined over them. The goal is to maximize the submodular function while guaranteeing that the total weight does not exceed a specified budget (the knapsack constraint) and that the number of elements selected for each color falls within a designated range (the fairness constraint). While there exists some recent literature on this topic, the existence of a non-trivial approximation for the problem -- without relaxing either the knapsack or fairness constraints -- remains a challenging open question. This paper makes progress in this direction. We demonstrate that when the number of colors is constant, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a constant approximation with high probability. Additionally, we show that if either the knapsack or fairness constraint is relaxed only to require expected satisfaction, a tight approximation ratio of $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$ can be obtained in expectation for any $\epsilon >0$.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online Knapsack Problems with Estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21750v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine you are a computer scientist who enjoys attending conferences or workshops within the year. Sadly, your travel budget is limited, so you must select a subset of events you can travel to. When you are aware of all possible events and their costs at the beginning of the year, you can select the subset of the possible events that maximizes your happiness and is within your budget. On the other hand, if you are blind about the options, you will likely have a hard time when trying to decide if you want to register somewhere or not, and will likely regret decisions you made in the future. These scenarios can be modeled by knapsack variants, either by an offline or an online problem. However, both scenarios are somewhat unrealistic: Usually, you will not know the exact costs of each workshop at the beginning of the year. The online version, however, is too pessimistic, as you might already know which options there are and how much they cost roughly. At some point, you have to decide whether to register for some workshop, but then you are aware of the conference fee and the flight and hotel prices. We model this problem within the setting of online knapsack problems with estimates: in the beginning, you receive a list of potential items with their estimated size as well as the accuracy of the estimates. Then, the items are revealed one by one in an online fashion with their actual size, and you need to decide whether to take one or not. In this article, we show a best-possible algorithm for each estimate accuracy $\delta$ (i.e., when each actual item size can deviate by $\pm \delta$ from the announced size) for both the simple knapsack and the simple knapsack with removability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Online General Knapsack with Reservation Costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20855v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the online general knapsack problem, an algorithm is presented with an item $x=(s,v)$ of size $s$ and value $v$ and must irrevocably choose to pack such an item into the knapsack or reject it before the next item appears. The goal is to maximize the total value of the packed items without overflowing the knapsack's capacity. As this classical setting is way too harsh for many real-life applications, we will analyze the online general knapsack problem under the reservation model. Here, instead of accepting or rejecting an item immediately, an algorithm can delay the decision of whether to pack the item by paying a fraction $0\le \alpha$ of the size or the value of the item. This models many practical applications, where, for example, decisions can be delayed for some costs e.g. cancellation fees. We present results for both variants: First, for costs depending on the size of the items and then for costs depending on the value of the items. If the reservation costs depend on the size of the items, we find a matching upper and lower bound of $2$ for every $\alpha$. On the other hand, if the reservation costs depend on the value of the items, we find that no algorithm is competitive for reservation costs larger than $1/2$ of the item value, and we find upper and lower bounds for the rest of the reservation range $0\le\alpha< 1/2$.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Knapsack on Graphs with Relaxed Neighborhood Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17297v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the knapsack problems with neighborhood constraints that were studied before, the input is a graph $\mathcal{G}$ on a set $\mathcal{V}$ of items, each item $v \in \mathcal{V}$ has a weight $w_v$ and profit $p_v$, the size $s$ of the knapsack, and the demand $d$. The goal is to compute if there exists a feasible solution whose total weight is at most $s$ and total profit is at most $d$. Here, feasible solutions are all subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of the items such that, for every item in $\mathcal{S}$, at least one of its neighbors in $\mathcal{G}$ is also in $\mathcal{S}$ for \hor, and all its neighbors in $\mathcal{G}$ are also in $\mathcal{S}$ for \hand~\cite{borradaile2012knapsack}. We study a relaxation of the above problems. Specifically, we allow all possible subsets of items to be feasible solutions. However, only those items for which we pick at least one or all of its neighbor (out-neighbor for directed graph) contribute to profit whereas every item picked contribute to the weight; we call the corresponding problems \sor and \sand. We show that both \sor and \sand are strongly \NPC even on undirected graphs. Regarding parameterized complexity, we show both \sor and \hor are \WTH parameterized by the size $s$ of the knapsack size. Interestingly, both \sand and \hand are \WOH parameterized by knapsack size, $s$ plus profit demand, $d$ and also parameterized by solution size, $b$. For \sor and \hor, we present a randomized color-coding-based pseudo-\FPT algorithm, parameterized by the solution size $b$, and consequently by the demand $d$. We then consider the treewidth of the input graph as our parameter and design pseudo fixed-parameter tractable (\FPT) algorithm parameterized by treewidth, $\text{tw}$ for all variants. Finally, we present an additive $1$ approximation for \sor when both the weight and profit of every vertex is $1$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Knapsack for Sequential Competitive Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16752v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses competitive resource allocation in a sequential setting, where two players allocate resources across objects or locations of shared interest. Departing from the simultaneous Colonel Blotto game, our framework introduces a sequential decision-making dynamic, where players act with partial or complete knowledge of previous moves. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on complex mixed strategies, we focus on deterministic pure strategies, streamlining computation while preserving strategic depth. Additionally, we extend the payoff structure to accommodate fractional allocations and payoffs, moving beyond the binary, all-or-nothing paradigm to allow more granular outcomes. We model this problem as an adversarial knapsack game, formulating it as a bilevel optimization problem that integrates the leader's objective with the follower's best-response. This knapsack-based approach is novel in the context of competitive resource allocation, with prior work only partially leveraging it for follower analysis. Our contributions include: (1) proposing an adversarial knapsack formulation for the sequential resource allocation problem, (2) developing efficient heuristics for fractional allocation scenarios, and (3) analyzing the 0-1 knapsack case, providing a computational hardness result alongside a heuristic solution.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Weakly Approximating Knapsack in Subquadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15001v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the classic Knapsack problem. Let $t$ and $\mathrm{OPT}$ be the capacity and the optimal value, respectively. If one seeks a solution with total profit at least $\mathrm{OPT}/(1 + \varepsilon)$ and total weight at most $t$, then Knapsack can be solved in $\tilde{O}(n + (\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^2)$ time [Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang '24][Mao '24]. This running time is the best possible (up to a logarithmic factor), assuming that $(\min,+)$-convolution cannot be solved in truly subquadratic time [K\"unnemann, Paturi, and Schneider '17][Cygan, Mucha, W\k{e}grzycki, and W{\l}odarczyk '19]. The same upper and lower bounds hold if one seeks a solution with total profit at least $\mathrm{OPT}$ and total weight at most $(1 + \varepsilon)t$. Therefore, it is natural to ask the following question. If one seeks a solution with total profit at least $\mathrm{OPT}/(1+\varepsilon)$ and total weight at most $(1 + \varepsilon)t$, can Knsapck be solved in $\tilde{O}(n + (\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{2-\delta})$ time for some constant $\delta > 0$? We answer this open question affirmatively by proposing an $\tilde{O}(n + (\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{7/4})$-time algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICALP2025</p></details> |
| **[The Competitive Ratio of Threshold Policies for Online Unit-density Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08735v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a wholesale supply chain ordering problem. In this problem, the supplier has an initial stock, and faces an unpredictable stream of incoming orders, making real-time decisions on whether to accept or reject each order. What makes this wholesale supply chain ordering problem special is its ``knapsack constraint,'' that is, we do not allow partially accepting an order or splitting an order. The objective is to maximize the utilized stock. We model this wholesale supply chain ordering problem as an online unit-density knapsack problem. We study randomized threshold algorithms that accept an item as long as its size exceeds the threshold. We derive two optimal threshold distributions, the first is 0.4324-competitive relative to the optimal offline integral packing, and the second is 0.4285-competitive relative to the optimal offline fractional packing. Both results require optimizing the cumulative distribution function of the random threshold, which are challenging infinite-dimensional optimization problems. We also consider the generalization to multiple knapsacks, where an arriving item has a different size in each knapsack. We derive a 0.2142-competitive algorithm for this problem. We also show that any randomized algorithm for this problem cannot be more than 0.4605-competitive. This is the first upper bound strictly less than 0.5, which implies the intrinsic challenge of knapsack constraint. We show how to naturally implement our optimal threshold distributions in the warehouses of a Latin American chain department store. We run simulations on their order data, which demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Computation Algorithms for Knapsack: impossibility results, and how to avoid them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01543v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local Computation Algorithms (LCA), as introduced by Rubinfeld, Tamir, Vardi, and Xie (2011), are a type of ultra-efficient algorithms which, given access to a (large) input for a given computational task, are required to provide fast query access to a consistent output solution, without maintaining a state between queries. This paradigm of computation in particular allows for hugely distributed algorithms, where independent instances of a given LCA provide consistent access to a common output solution. The past decade has seen a significant amount of work on LCAs, by and large focusing on graph problems. In this paper, we initiate the study of Local Computation Algorithms for perhaps the archetypal combinatorial optimization problem, Knapsack. We first establish strong impossibility results, ruling out the existence of any non-trivial LCA for Knapsack as several of its relaxations. We then show how equipping the LCA with additional access to the Knapsack instance, namely, weighted item sampling, allows one to circumvent these impossibility results, and obtain sublinear-time and query LCAs. Our positive result draws on a connection to the recent notion of reproducibility for learning algorithms (Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell, 2022), a connection we believe to be of independent interest for the design of LCAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Assignment and Knapsack Problems in the Random-Order Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01486v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study different online optimization problems in the random-order model. There is a finite set of bins with known capacity and a finite set of items arriving in a random order. Upon arrival of an item, its size and its value for each of the bins is revealed and it has to be decided immediately and irrevocably to which bin the item is assigned, or to not assign the item at all. In this setting, an algorithm is $\alpha$-competitive if the total value of all items assigned to the bins is at least an $\alpha$-fraction of the total value of an optimal assignment that knows all items beforehand. We give an algorithm that is $\alpha$-competitive with $\alpha = (1-\ln(2))/2 \approx 1/6.52$ improving upon the previous best algorithm with $\alpha \approx 1/6.99$ for the generalized assignment problem and the previous best algorithm with $\alpha \approx 1/6.65$ for the integral knapsack problem. We then study the fractional knapsack problem where we have a single bin and it is also allowed to pack items fractionally. For that case, we obtain an algorithm that is $\alpha$-competitive with $\alpha = 1/e \approx 1/2.71$ improving on the previous best algorithm with $\alpha = 1/4.39$. We further show that this competitive ratio is the best-possible for deterministic algorithms in this model.</p></details> |  |

The games chosen to exemplify are: Hashiwokakero, N-Queens, Kakuro, Inshi no heya, and Peg Solitaire. Although some of these games have already been formulated in a QUBO formulation, we are going to approach them with more general formulations, allowing their execution in new quantum or quantum-inspired optimization algorithms. This can be an easier way to introduce these more complicated formulations for harder problems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Improved Approximation Algorithms for Three-Dimensional Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19365v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the three-dimensional Knapsack (3DK) problem, in which we are given a set of axis-aligned cuboids with associated profits and an axis-aligned cube knapsack. The objective is to find a non-overlapping axis-aligned packing (by translation) of the maximum profit subset of cuboids into the cube. The previous best approximation algorithm is due to Diedrich, Harren, Jansen, Th\"{o}le, and Thomas (2008), who gave a $(7+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for 3DK and a $(5+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the variant when the items can be rotated by 90 degrees around any axis, for any constant $\varepsilon>0$. Chleb\'{\i}k and Chleb\'{\i}kov\'{a} (2009) showed that the problem does not admit an asymptotic polynomial-time approximation scheme. We provide an improved polynomial-time $(139/29+\varepsilon) \approx 4.794$-approximation algorithm for 3DK and $(30/7+\varepsilon) \approx 4.286$-approximation when rotations by 90 degrees are allowed. We also provide improved approximation algorithms for several variants such as the cardinality case (when all items have the same profit) and uniform profit-density case (when the profit of an item is equal to its volume). Our key technical contribution is container packing -- a structured packing in 3D such that all items are assigned into a constant number of containers, and each container is packed using a specific strategy based on its type. We first show the existence of highly profitable container packings. Thereafter, we show that one can find near-optimal container packing efficiently using a variant of the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP).</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Bandwidth Observation Sharing for Multi-Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Intelligent Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09975v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation is increasingly crucial in various domains, including disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse and manufacturing automation. Robot teams often must operate in highly dynamic environments and under strict bandwidth constraints imposed by communication infrastructure, rendering effective observation sharing within the system a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel optimal communication scheme, Intelligent Knapsack (iKnap), for multi-robot navigation in dynamic environments under bandwidth constraints. We model multi-robot communication as belief propagation in a graph of inferential agents. We then formulate the combinatorial optimization for observation sharing as a 0/1 knapsack problem, where each potential pairwise communication between robots is assigned a decision-making utility to be weighed against its bandwidth cost, and the system has some cumulative bandwidth limit. We evaluate our approach in a simulated robotic warehouse with human workers using ROS2 and the Open Robotics Middleware Framework. Compared to state-of-the-art broadcast-based optimal communication schemes, iKnap yields significant improvements in navigation performance with respect to scenario complexity while maintaining a similar runtime. Furthermore, iKnap utilizes allocated bandwidth and observational resources more efficiently than existing approaches, especially in very low-resource and high-uncertainty settings. Based on these results, we claim that the proposed method enables more robust collaboration for multi-robot teams in real-world navigation problems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generative-enhanced optimization for knapsack problems: an industry-relevant study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04928v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is a crucial task in various industries such as logistics, aviation, manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and insurance, where finding the best solution to a problem can result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency. Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bandits with Anytime Knapsacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18560v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider bandits with anytime knapsacks (BwAK), a novel version of the BwK problem where there is an \textit{anytime} cost constraint instead of a total cost budget. This problem setting introduces additional complexities as it mandates adherence to the constraint throughout the decision-making process. We propose SUAK, an algorithm that utilizes upper confidence bounds to identify the optimal mixture of arms while maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation. SUAK is an adaptive algorithm that strategically utilizes the available budget in each round in the decision-making process and skips a round when it is possible to violate the anytime cost constraint. In particular, SUAK slightly under-utilizes the available cost budget to reduce the need for skipping rounds. We show that SUAK attains the same problem-dependent regret upper bound of $ O(K \log T)$ established in prior work under the simpler BwK framework. Finally, we provide simulations to verify the utility of SUAK in practical settings.</p></details> |  |

This improves upon the $\widetilde{O}(n + (1/\varepsilon)^{11/5})$-time algorithm by Deng, Jin, and Mao [\textit{Proceedings of the 2023 Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2023}]. Our algorithm is the best possible (up to a polylogarithmic factor) conditioned on the conjecture that $(\min, +)$-convolution has no truly subquadratic-time algorithm, since this conjecture implies that Knapsack has no $O((n + 1/\varepsilon)^{2-\delta})$-time FPTAS for any constant $\delta > 0$.</p></details> |  |

While both algorithms perform well for unconstrained problems, their effectiveness diminishes when constraints are introduced due to limitations in exploration, exploitation, and constraint handling. To overcome these challenges, a hybrid FAGA algorithm is proposed, combining the strengths of both algorithms. The hybrid algorithm is validated by solving unconstrained benchmark functions and constrained optimization problems, including design engineering problems and combinatorial problems such as the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. The proposed algorithm delivers improved solution accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional optimization algorithm. This paper outlines the development and structure of the hybrid algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness in handling complex optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

Even if $d=2$ and all input objects are disks, this problem is known to be \textsf{NP}-hard [Demaine, Fekete, Lang, 2010]. In this paper, we give polynomial time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the following types of input objects in any constant dimension $d$: - disks and hyperspheres, - a class of fat convex polygons that generalizes regular $k$-gons for $k\ge 5$ (formally, polygons with a constant number of edges, whose lengths are in a bounded range, and in which each angle is strictly larger than $\pi/2$), - arbitrary fat convex objects that are sufficiently small compared to the knapsack. We remark that in our \textsf{PTAS} for disks and hyperspheres, we output the computed set of objects, but for a $O_\varepsilon(1)$ of them, we determine their coordinates only up to an exponentially small error. However, it is unclear whether there always exists a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution that uses only rational coordinates for the disks' centers. We leave this as an open problem that is related to well-studied geometric questions in the realm of circle packing.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of the work appeared in the proceedings of the 51st EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP) 2024</p></details> |

For a finitely generated group we study the so-called power word problem (does a given expression $u_1^{k_1} \ldots u_d^{k_d}$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d$ are words over the group generators and $k_1, \ldots, k_d$ are binary encoded integers, evaluate to the group identity?) and knapsack problem (does a given equation $u_1^{x_1} \ldots u_d^{x_d} = v$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d,v$ are words over the group generators and $x_1,\ldots,x_d$ are variables, has a solution in the natural numbers). We prove that the power word problem for wreath products of the form $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$ with $G$ nilpotent and iterated wreath products of free abelian groups belongs to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. As an application of the latter, the power word problem for free solvable groups is in $\mathsf{TC}^0$. On the other hand we show that for wreath products $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is a so called uniformly strongly efficiently non-solvable group (which form a large subclass of non-solvable groups), the power word problem is $\mathsf{coNP}$-hard. For the knapsack problem we show $\mathsf{NP}$-completeness for iterated wreath products of free abelian groups and hence free solvable groups. Moreover, the knapsack problem for every wreath product $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is uniformly efficiently non-solvable, is $\Sigma^2_p$-hard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation Algorithms for Correlated Knapsack Orienteering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16566v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the {\em correlated knapsack orienteering} (CSKO) problem: we are given a travel budget $B$, processing-time budget $W$, finite metric space $(V,d)$ with root $\rho\in V$, where each vertex is associated with a job with possibly correlated random size and random reward that become known only when the job completes. Random variables are independent across different vertices. The goal is to compute a $\rho$-rooted path of length at most $B$, in a possibly adaptive fashion, that maximizes the reward collected from jobs that are processed by time $W$. To our knowledge, CSKO has not been considered before, though prior work has considered the uncorrelated problem, {\em stochastic knapsack orienteering}, and {\em correlated orienteering}, which features only one budget constraint on the {\em sum} of travel-time and processing-times. We show that the {\em adaptivity gap of CSKO is not a constant, and is at least $\Omega\bigl(\max\sqrt{\log{B}},\sqrt{\log\log{W}}\}\bigr)$}. Complementing this, we devise {\em non-adaptive} algorithms that obtain: (a) $O(\log\log W)$-approximation in quasi-polytime; and (b) $O(\log W)$-approximation in polytime. We obtain similar guarantees for CSKO with cancellations, wherein a job can be cancelled before its completion time, foregoing its reward. We also consider the special case of CSKO, wherein job sizes are weighted Bernoulli distributions, and more generally where the distributions are supported on at most two points (2-CSKO). Although weighted Bernoulli distributions suffice to yield an $\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log B})$ adaptivity-gap lower bound for (uncorrelated) {\em stochastic orienteering}, we show that they are easy instances for CSKO. We develop non-adaptive algorithms that achieve $O(1)$-approximation in polytime for weighted Bernoulli distributions, and in $(n+\log B)^{O(\log W)}$-time for the more general case of 2-CSKO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of APPROX 2024 paper</p></details> |
| **[Shadoks Approach to Knapsack Polygonal Packing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20123v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2024 edition of the CG:SHOP Challenge focused on the knapsack polygonal packing problem. Each instance consists of a convex polygon known as the container and a multiset of items, where each item is a simple polygon with an associated integer value. A feasible packing solution places a selection of the items inside the container without overlapping and using only translations. The goal is to achieve a packing that maximizes the total value of the items in the solution. Our approach to win first place is divided into two main steps. First, we generate promising initial solutions using two strategies: one based on integer linear programming and the other on employing a combination of geometric greedy heuristics. In the second step, we enhance these solutions through local search techniques, which involve repositioning items and exploring potential replacements to improve the total value of the packing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A quantum algorithm for solving 0-1 Knapsack problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06623v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we present two novel contributions for achieving quantum advantage in solving difficult optimisation problems, both in theory and foreseeable practice. (1) We introduce the "Quantum Tree Generator", an approach to generate in superposition all feasible solutions of a given instance, yielding together with amplitude amplification the optimal solutions for 0-1 knapsack problems. The QTG offers massive memory savings and enables competitive runtimes compared to the classical state-of-the-art knapsack solvers (such as COMBO, Gurobi, CP-SAT, Greedy) already for instances involving as few as 100 variables. (2) By introducing a new runtime calculation technique that exploits logging data from the classical solver COMBO, we can predict the runtime of our method way beyond the range of existing quantum platforms and simulators, for various benchmark instances with up to 600 variables. Combining both of these innovations, we demonstrate the QTG's potential practical quantum advantage for large-scale problems, indicating an effective approach for combinatorial optimisation problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+13 ...</summary><p>6+13 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Online Unbounded Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02045v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the competitive ratio and the advice complexity of the online unbounded knapsack problem. An instance is given as a sequence of n items with a size and a value each, and an algorithm has to decide how often to pack each item into a knapsack of bounded capacity. The items are given online and the total size of the packed items must not exceed the knapsack's capacity, while the objective is to maximize the total value of the packed items. While each item can only be packed once in the classical 0-1 knapsack problem, the unbounded version allows for items to be packed multiple times. We show that the simple unbounded knapsack problem, where the size of each item is equal to its value, allows for a competitive ratio of 2. We also analyze randomized algorithms and show that, in contrast to the 0-1 knapsack problem, one uniformly random bit cannot improve an algorithm's performance. More randomness lowers the competitive ratio to less than 1.736, but it can never be below 1.693. In the advice complexity setting, we measure how many bits of information the algorithm has to know to achieve some desired solution quality. For the simple unbounded knapsack problem, one advice bit lowers the competitive ratio to 3/2. While this cannot be improved with fewer than log(n) advice bits for instances of length n, a competitive ratio of 1+epsilon can be achieved with O(log(n/epsilon)/epsilon) advice bits for any epsilon>0. We further show that no amount of advice bounded by a function f(n) allows an algorithm to be optimal. We also study the online general unbounded knapsack problem and show that it does not allow for any bounded competitive ratio for deterministic and randomized algorithms, as well as for algorithms using fewer than log(n) advice bits. We also provide an algorithm that uses O(log(n/epsilon)/epsilon) advice bits to achieve a competitive ratio of 1+epsilon for any epsilon>0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximately Counting Knapsack Solutions in Subquadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22267v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the classic #Knapsack problem, which asks to count the Boolean points $(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\{0,1\}^n$ in a given half-space $\sum_{i=1}^nW_ix_i\le T$. This #P-complete problem admits $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation. Before this work, [Dyer, STOC 2003]'s $\tilde{O}(n^{2.5}+n^2{\epsilon^{-2}})$-time randomized approximation scheme remains the fastest known in the natural regime of $\epsilon\ge 1/polylog(n)$. In this paper, we give a randomized $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm in $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}{\epsilon^{-2}})$ time (in the standard word-RAM model), achieving the first sub-quadratic dependence on $n$. Such sub-quadratic running time is rare in the approximate counting literature in general, as a large class of algorithms naturally faces a quadratic-time barrier. Our algorithm follows Dyer's framework, which reduces #Knapsack to the task of sampling (and approximately counting) solutions in a randomly rounded instance with poly(n)-bounded integer weights. We refine Dyer's framework using the following ideas: - We decrease the sample complexity of Dyer's Monte Carlo method, by proving some structural lemmas for typical points near the input hyperplane via hitting-set arguments, and appropriately setting the rounding scale. - Instead of running a vanilla dynamic program on the rounded instance, we employ techniques from the growing field of pseudopolynomial-time Subset Sum algorithms, such as FFT, divide-and-conquer, and balls-into-bins hashing of [Bringmann, SODA 2017]. We also need other ingredients, including a surprising application of the recent Bounded Monotone (max,+)-Convolution algorithm by [Chi-Duan-Xie-Zhang, STOC 2022] (adapted by [Bringmann-D\"urr-Polak, ESA 2024]), the notion of sum-approximation from [Gawrychowski-Markin-Weimann, ICALP 2018]'s #Knapsack approximation scheme, and a two-phase extension of Dyer's framework for handling tiny weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SODA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Maximizing a Submodular Function with Bounded Curvature under an Unknown Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09668v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under an unknown knapsack constraint. A solution to this problem is a policy that decides which item to pack next based on the past packing history. The robustness factor of a policy is the worst case ratio of the solution obtained by following the policy and an optimal solution that knows the knapsack capacity. We develop a policy with a robustness factor that is decreasing in the curvature $c$ of the submodular function. For the extreme cases $c=0$ corresponding to an additive objective function, it matches a previously known and best possible robustness factor of $1/2$. For the other extreme case of $c=1$ it yields a robustness factor of $\approx 0.35$ improving over the best previously known robustness factor of $\approx 0.06$. The analysis of our policy relies on a greedy algorithm that is a slight modification of Wolsey's greedy algorithm for the submodular knapsack problem with a known knapsack constraint. We obtain tight approximation guarantees for both of these algorithms in the setting of a submodular objective function with curvature $c$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Packing a Knapsack with Items Owned by Strategic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06080v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a scenario within the field of mechanism design without money where a mechanism designer is interested in selecting items with maximum total value under a knapsack constraint. The items, however, are controlled by strategic agents who aim to maximize the total value of their items in the knapsack. This is a natural setting, e.g., when agencies select projects for funding, companies select products for sale in their shops, or hospitals schedule MRI scans for the day. A mechanism governing the packing of the knapsack is strategyproof if no agent can benefit from hiding items controlled by them to the mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that are strategyproof and $\alpha$-approximate in the sense that they always approximate the maximum value of the knapsack by a factor of $\alpha \in [0,1]$. First, we give a deterministic mechanism that is $\frac{1}{3}$-approximate. For the special case where all items have unit density, we design a $\frac{1}{\phi}$-approximate mechanism where $1/\phi \approx 0.618$ is the inverse of the golden ratio. This result is tight as we show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism with a better approximation exists. We further give randomized mechanisms with approximation guarantees of $1/2$ for the general case and $2/3$ for the case of unit densities. For both cases, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve an approximation guarantee better than $1/(5\phi -7)\approx 0.917$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knapsack with Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Hitting Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01057v4)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, with vertex weights $(w(u))_{u\in\mathcal{V}}$, vertex values $(\alpha(u))_{u\in\mathcal{V}}$, a knapsack size $s$, and a target value $d$, the \vcknapsack problem is to determine if there exists a subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathcal{V}$ of vertices such that $\mathcal{U}$ forms a vertex cover, $w(\mathcal{U})=\sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}} w(u) \le s$, and $\alpha(\mathcal{U})=\sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}} \alpha(u) \ge d$. In this paper, we closely study the \vcknapsack problem and its variations, such as \vcknapsackbudget, \minimalvcknapsack, and \minimumvcknapsack, for both general graphs and trees. We first prove that the \vcknapsack problem belongs to the complexity class \NPC and then study the complexity of the other variations. We generalize the problem to \setc and \hs versions and design polynomial time $H_g$-factor approximation algorithm for the \setckp problem and d-factor approximation algorithm for \hstp using primal dual method. We further show that \setcks and \hsmb are hard to approximate in polynomial time. Additionally, we develop a fixed parameter tractable algorithm running in time $8^{\mathcal{O}({\rm tw})}\cdot n\cdot {\sf min}\{s,d\}$ where ${\rm tw},s,d,n$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, the size of the knapsack, the target value of the knapsack, and the number of items for the \minimalvcknapsack problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Parallel Algorithm for Non-Monotone Submodular Maximization under Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04415v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes an efficient parallel algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint problem over the ground set of size $n$. Our algorithm improves the best approximation factor of the existing parallel one from $8+\epsilon$ to $7+\epsilon$ with $O(\log n)$ adaptive complexity. The key idea of our approach is to create a new alternate threshold algorithmic framework. This strategy alternately constructs two disjoint candidate solutions within a constant number of sequence rounds. Then, the algorithm boosts solution quality without sacrificing the adaptive complexity. Extensive experimental studies on three applications, Revenue Maximization, Image Summarization, and Maximum Weighted Cut, show that our algorithm not only significantly increases solution quality but also requires comparative adaptivity to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the Thirty-Third International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), Main Track</p></details> |

The central issue is to determine a cost allocation to each user that, in total, recovers as much as possible of the actual cost while satisfying a stabilizing condition known as the {\it core property}. The ratio between the total service cost and the cost recovered from users has been studied previously, with seminal papers of Deng, Ibaraki, \& Nagomochi and Goemans \& Skutella linking this {\it price-of-fair-sharing} to the integrality gap of an associated LP relaxation. Motivated by an application of cost allocation for network design for LPWANs, an emerging IoT technology, we investigate a general class of CIPs and give the first non-trivial price-of-fair-sharing bounds by using the natural LP relaxation strengthened with knapsack-cover inequalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these LP-based methods outperform previously known methods on an LPWAN-derived CIP data set. We also obtain analogous results for a more general setting in which the service provider also gets to select the subset of users, and the mechanism to elicit users' private utilities should be group-strategyproof. The key to obtaining this result is a simplified and improved analysis for a cross-monotone cost-allocation mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper appearing in proceedings of WAOA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fine Grained Lower Bounds for Multidimensional Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10146v1)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the $d$-dimensional knapsack problem. We are given a set of items, each with a $d$-dimensional cost vector and a profit, along with a $d$-dimensional budget vector. The goal is to select a set of items that do not exceed the budget in all dimensions and maximize the total profit. A PTAS with running time $n^{\Theta(d/\varepsilon)}$ has long been known for this problem, where $\varepsilon$ is the error parameter and $n$ is the encoding size. Despite decades of active research, the best running time of a PTAS has remained $O(n^{\lceil d/\varepsilon \rceil - d})$. Unfortunately, existing lower bounds only cover the special case with two dimensions $d = 2$, and do not answer whether there is a $n^{o(d/\varepsilon)}$-time PTAS for larger values of $d$. The status of exact algorithms is similar: there is a simple $O(n \cdot W^d)$-time (exact) dynamic programming algorithm, where $W$ is the maximum budget, but there is no lower bound which explains the strong exponential dependence on $d$. In this work, we show that the running times of the best-known PTAS and exact algorithm cannot be improved up to a polylogarithmic factor assuming Gap-ETH. Our techniques are based on a robust reduction from 2-CSP, which embeds 2-CSP constraints into a desired number of dimensions, exhibiting tight trade-off between $d$ and $\varepsilon$ for most regimes of the parameters. Informally, we obtain the following main results for $d$-dimensional knapsack. No $n^{o(d/\varepsilon \cdot 1/(\log(d/\varepsilon))^2)}$-time $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation for every $\varepsilon = O(1/\log d)$. No $(n+W)^{o(d/\log d)}$-time exact algorithm (assuming ETH). No $n^{o(\sqrt{d})}$-time $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation for constant $\varepsilon$. $(d \cdot \log W)^{O(d^2)} + n^{O(1)}$-time $\Omega(1/\sqrt{d})$-approximation and a matching $n^{O(1)}$-time lower~bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Practical Benchmarks of Ising Machines: A Case Study on the Quadratic Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19175v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization has wide applications from industry to natural science. Ising machines bring an emerging computing paradigm for efficiently solving a combinatorial optimization problem by searching a ground state of a given Ising model. Current cutting-edge Ising machines achieve fast sampling of near-optimal solutions of the max-cut problem. However, for problems with additional constraint conditions, their advantages have been hardly shown due to difficulties in handling the constraints. In this work, we focus on benchmarks of Ising machines on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To bring out their practical performance, we propose fast two-stage post-processing for Ising machines, which makes handling the constraint easier. Simulation based on simulated annealing shows that the proposed method substantially improves the solving performance of Ising machines and the improvement is robust to a choice of encoding of the constraint condition. Through evaluation using an Ising machine called Amplify Annealing Engine, the proposed method is shown to dramatically improve its solving performance on the QKP. These results are a crucial step toward showing advantages of Ising machines on practical problems involving various constraint conditions.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Provably Good Solutions to the Knapsack Problem via Neural Networks of Bounded Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14105v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of a satisfying and rigorous mathematical understanding of the performance of neural networks is a major challenge in artificial intelligence. Against this background, we study the expressive power of neural networks through the example of the classical NP-hard Knapsack Problem. Our main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with rectified linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a Knapsack instance and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. We show that an RNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum Knapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions. We also prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of the computed Knapsack solution: for Knapsack instances consisting of $n$ items, an RNN of depth five and width $w$ computes a solution of value at least $1-\mathcal{O}(n^2/\sqrt{w})$ times the optimum solution value. Our results build upon a classical dynamic programming formulation of the Knapsack Problem as well as a careful rounding of profit values that are also at the core of the well-known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Knapsack Problem. A carefully conducted computational study qualitatively supports our theoretical size bounds. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized to many other combinatorial optimization problems that admit dynamic programming solution methods, such as various Shortest Path Problems, the Longest Common Subsequence Problem, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors' accepted manuscript for the INFORMS Journal on Computing.

| **[A Re-solving Heuristic for Dynamic Assortment Optimization with Knapsack Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05564v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization highly non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Even Faster Knapsack via Rectangular Monotone Min-Plus Convolution and Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05681v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for the Knapsack problem that has running time $\widetilde{O}(n + t\sqrt{p_{\max}})$, where $n$ is the number of items, $t$ is the knapsack capacity, and $p_{\max}$ is the maximum item profit. This improves over the $\widetilde{O}(n + t \, p_{\max})$-time algorithm based on the convolution and prediction technique by Bateni et al.~(STOC 2018). Moreover, we give some evidence, based on a strengthening of the Min-Plus Convolution Hypothesis, that our running time might be optimal. Our algorithm uses two new technical tools, which might be of independent interest. First, we generalize the $\widetilde{O}(n^{1.5})$-time algorithm for bounded monotone min-plus convolution by Chi et al.~(STOC 2022) to the \emph{rectangular} case where the range of entries can be different from the sequence length. Second, we give a reduction from general knapsack instances to \emph{balanced} instances, where all items have nearly the same profit-to-weight ratio, up to a constant factor. Using these techniques, we can also obtain algorithms that run in time $\widetilde{O}(n + OPT\sqrt{w_{\max}})$, $\widetilde{O}(n + (nw_{\max}p_{\max})^{1/3}t^{2/3})$, and $\widetilde{O}(n + (nw_{\max}p_{\max})^{1/3} OPT^{2/3})$, where $OPT$ is the optimal total profit and $w_{\max}$ is the maximum item weight.</p></details> |  |
| **[An EPTAS for Cardinality Constrained Multiple Knapsack via Iterative Randomized Rounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12622v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In [Math. Oper. Res., 2011], Fleischer et al. introduced a powerful technique for solving the generic class of separable assignment problems (SAP), in which a set of items of given values and weights needs to be packed into a set of bins subject to separable assignment constraints, so as to maximize the total value. The approach of Fleischer at al. relies on solving a configuration LP and sampling a configuration for each bin independently based on the LP solution. While there is a SAP variant for which this approach yields the best possible approximation ratio, for various special cases, there are discrepancies between the approximation ratios obtained using the above approach and the state-of-the-art approximations. This raises the following natural question: Can we do better by iteratively solving the configuration LP and sampling a few bins at a time? To assess the potential gain from iterative randomized rounding, we consider as a case study one interesting SAP variant, namely, Uniform Cardinality Constrained Multiple Knapsack, for which we answer this question affirmatively. The input is a set of items, each has a value and a weight, and a set of uniform capacity bins. The goal is to assign a subset of the items of maximum total value to the bins such that $(i)$ the capacity of any bin is not exceeded, and $(ii)$ the number of items assigned to each bin satisfies a given cardinality constraint. While the technique of Fleischer et al. yields a $\left(1-\frac{1}{e}\right)$-approximation for the problem, we show that iterative randomized rounding leads to an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS), thus essentially resolving the complexity status of the problem. Our analysis of iterative randomized rounding can be useful for solving other SAP variants.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm combining evolutionary computation with the exact algorithm to solve the 0-1 MKP. It maintains a set of solutions and utilizes the information from the population to extract good partial assignments. To find high-quality solutions, an exact algorithm is applied to explore the promising search space specified by the good partial assignments. The new solutions are used to update the population. Thus, the good partial assignments evolve towards a better direction with the improvement of the population. Extensive experimentation with commonly used benchmark sets shows that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms, TPTEA and DQPSO, as well as the commercial solver CPlex. It finds better solutions than the existing algorithms and provides new lower bounds for 10 large and hard instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized heuristic repair for large-scale multidimensional knapsack problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15569v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem whose solution is determining a subset of maximum total profit items that do not violate capacity constraints. Due to its hardness, large-scale MKP instances are usually a target for metaheuristics, a context in which effective feasibility maintenance strategies are crucial. In 1998, Chu and Beasley proposed an effective heuristic repair that is still relevant for recent metaheuristics. However, due to its deterministic nature, the diversity of solutions such heuristic provides is insufficient for long runs. As a result, the search for new solutions ceases after a while. This paper proposes an efficiency-based randomization strategy for the heuristic repair that increases the variability of the repaired solutions without deteriorating quality and improves the overall results.</p></details> |  |

The KP has several variants and, in this paper, we address the binary KP, where for a given knapsack (with limited capacity) as well as a number of items, each of them has its own weight (volume or cost) and value, the objective consists in finding a selection of items such that the total value of the selected items is maximized and the capacity limit of the knapsack is respected. In this paper, in memorial of Prof. Dr. Heiner M{\"u}ller-Merbach, a former president of IFORS, we address the binary KP and revisit a classical algorithm, named cascading-tree branch-and-bound algorithm, that was originally introduced by him in 1978. However, the algorithm is surprisingly absent from the scientific literature because the paper was published in a German journal. We carried out computational experiments in order to compare the algorithm versus some classic methods. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the interesting idea used in the cascading-tree algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Average sensitivity of the Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13343v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In resource allocation, we often require that the output allocation of an algorithm is stable against input perturbation because frequent reallocation is costly and untrustworthy. Varma and Yoshida (SODA'21) formalized this requirement for algorithms as the notion of average sensitivity. Here, the average sensitivity of an algorithm on an input instance is, roughly speaking, the average size of the symmetric difference of the output for the instance and that for the instance with one item deleted, where the average is taken over the deleted item. In this work, we consider the average sensitivity of the knapsack problem, a representative example of a resource allocation problem. We first show a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the knapsack problem with average sensitivity $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$. Then, we complement this result by showing that any $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm has average sensitivity $\Omega(\epsilon^{-1})$. As an application of our algorithm, we consider the incremental knapsack problem in the random-order setting, where the goal is to maintain a good solution while items arrive one by one in a random order. Specifically, we show that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with amortized recourse $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$ and amortized update time $O(\log n+f_\epsilon)$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $f_\epsilon>0$ is a value depending on $\epsilon$.</p></details> | 23 pages, ESA 2022 |

The problem recently attracted a lot of attention due to its applications in various domains of combination optimization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We improve the approximation factor of the fastest deterministic algorithm from $6+\epsilon$ to $5+\epsilon$ while keeping the best query complexity of $O(n)$, where $\epsilon >0$ is a constant parameter. Our technique is based on optimizing the performance of two components: the threshold greedy subroutine and the building of two disjoint sets as candidate solutions. Besides, by carefully analyzing the cost of candidate solutions, we obtain a tighter approximation factor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Bidding in Knapsack Auctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07928v3)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines knapsack auctions as a method to solve the knapsack problem with incomplete information, where object values are private and sizes are public. We analyze three auction types-uniform price (UP), discriminatory price (DP), and generalized second price (GSP)-to determine efficient resource allocation in these settings. Using a Greedy algorithm for allocating objects, we analyze bidding behavior, revenue and efficiency of these three auctions using theory, lab experiments, and AI-enriched simulations. Our results suggest that the uniform-price auction has the highest level of truthful bidding and efficiency while the discriminatory price and the generalized second-price auctions are superior in terms of revenue generation. This study not only deepens the understanding of auction-based approaches to NP-hard problems but also provides practical insights for market design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Fairness in Online Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13293v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The online knapsack problem is a classic problem in the field of online algorithms. Its canonical version asks how to pack items of different values and weights arriving online into a capacity-limited knapsack so as to maximize the total value of the admitted items. Although optimal competitive algorithms are known for this problem, they may be fundamentally unfair, i.e., individual items may be treated inequitably in different ways. We formalize a practically-relevant notion of time fairness which effectively models a trade off between static and dynamic pricing in a motivating application such as cloud resource allocation, and show that existing algorithms perform poorly under this metric. We propose a parameterized deterministic algorithm where the parameter precisely captures the Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness (static pricing) and competitiveness (dynamic pricing). We show that randomization is theoretically powerful enough to be simultaneously competitive and fair; however, it does not work well in experiments. To further improve the trade-off between fairness and competitiveness, we develop a nearly-optimal learning-augmented algorithm which is fair, consistent, and robust (competitive), showing substantial performance improvements in numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024. 26 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms with Sliding Window Selection for the Dynamic Chance-Constrained Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08219v1)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms are particularly effective for optimisation problems with dynamic and stochastic components. We propose multi-objective evolutionary approaches for the knapsack problem with stochastic profits under static and dynamic weight constraints. The chance-constrained problem model allows us to effectively capture the stochastic profits and associate a confidence level to the solutions' profits. We consider a bi-objective formulation that maximises expected profit and minimises variance, which allows optimising the problem independent of a specific confidence level on the profit. We derive a three-objective formulation by relaxing the weight constraint into an additional objective. We consider the GSEMO algorithm with standard and a sliding window-based parent selection to evaluate the objective formulations. Moreover, we modify fitness formulations and algorithms for the dynamic problem variant to store some infeasible solutions to cater to future changes. We conduct experimental investigations on both problems using the proposed problem formulations and algorithms. Our results show that three-objective approaches outperform approaches that use bi-objective formulations, and they further improve when GSEMO uses sliding window selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using 3-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms for the Dynamic Chance Constrained Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06014v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world optimization problems often involve stochastic and dynamic components. Evolutionary algorithms are particularly effective in these scenarios, as they can easily adapt to uncertain and changing environments but often uncertainty and dynamic changes are studied in isolation. In this paper, we explore the use of 3-objective evolutionary algorithms for the chance constrained knapsack problem with dynamic constraints. In our setting, the weights of the items are stochastic and the knapsack's capacity changes over time. We introduce a 3-objective formulation that is able to deal with the stochastic and dynamic components at the same time and is independent of the confidence level required for the constraint. This new approach is then compared to the 2-objective formulation which is limited to a single confidence level. We evaluate the approach using two different multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), namely the global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO) and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), across various benchmark scenarios. Our analysis highlights the advantages of the 3-objective formulation over the 2-objective formulation in addressing the dynamic chance constrained knapsack problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[0-1 Knapsack in Nearly Quadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04093v2)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for the fundamental \emph{0-1 Knapsack} problem. Recent research interest has focused on its fine-grained complexity with respect to the number of items $n$ and the \emph{maximum item weight} $w_{\max}$. Under $(\min,+)$-convolution hypothesis, 0-1 Knapsack does not have $O((n+w_{\max})^{2-\delta})$ time algorithms (Cygan-Mucha-W\k{e}grzycki-W\l{}odarczyk 2017 and K\"{u}nnemann-Paturi-Schneider 2017). On the upper bound side, currently the fastest algorithm runs in $\tilde O(n + w_{\max}^{12/5})$ time (Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang 2023), improving the earlier $O(n + w_{\max}^3)$-time algorithm by Polak, Rohwedder, and W\k{e}grzycki (2021). In this paper, we close this gap between the upper bound and the conditional lower bound (up to subpolynomial factors): - The 0-1 Knapsack problem has a deterministic algorithm in $O(n + w_{\max}^{2}\log^4w_{\max})$ time. Our algorithm combines and extends several recent structural results and algorithmic techniques from the literature on knapsack-type problems: - We generalize the "fine-grained proximity" technique of Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang (2023) derived from the additive-combinatorial results of Bringmann and Wellnitz (2021) on dense subset sums. This allows us to bound the support size of the useful partial solutions in the dynamic program. - To exploit the small support size, our main technical component is a vast extension of the "witness propagation" method, originally designed by Deng, Mao, and Zhong (2023) for speeding up dynamic programming in the easier unbounded knapsack settings. To extend this approach to our 0-1 setting, we use a novel pruning method, as well as the two-level color-coding of Bringmann (2017) and the SMAWK algorithm on tall matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 co...</summary><p>v2 comment: To appear in STOC 2024. v1 comment: This paper supersedes an earlier manuscript arXiv:2307.09454 that contained weaker results.

| **[On contention resolution for the hypergraph matching, knapsack, and $k$-column sparse packing problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00041v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The contention resolution framework is a versatile rounding technique used as a part of the relaxation and rounding approach for solving constrained submodular function maximization problems. We apply this framework to the hypergraph matching, knapsack, and $k$-column sparse packing problems. In the hypergraph matching setting, we adapt the technique of Guruganesh, Lee (2018) to non-constructively prove that the correlation gap is at least $\frac{1-e^{-k}}{k}$ and provide a monotone $\left(b,\frac{1-e^{-bk}}{bk}\right)$-balanced contention resolution scheme, generalizing the results of Bruggmann, Zenklusen (2019). For the knapsack problem, we prove that the correlation gap of instances where exactly $k$ copies of each item fit into the knapsack is at least $\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2}$ and provide several monotone contention resolution schemes: a $\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2}$-balanced scheme for instances where all item sizes are strictly bigger than $\frac{1}{2}$, a $\frac{4}{9}$-balanced scheme for instances where all item sizes are at most $\frac{1}{2}$, and a $0.279$-balanced scheme for instances with arbitrary item sizes. For $k$-column sparse packing integer programs, we slightly modify the $\left(2k+o\left(k\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-CS-PIP based on the strengthened LP relaxation presented in Brubach et al. (2019) to obtain a $\frac{1}{4k+o\left(k\right)}$-balanced contention resolution scheme and hence a $\left(4k+o\left(k\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-CS-PIP based on the natural LP relaxation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis defended at ETH Zurich.

| **[A constant time complexity algorithm for the unbounded knapsack problem with bounded coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11320v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark instances for the unbounded knapsack problem are typically generated according to specific criteria within a given constant range $R$, and these instances can be referred to as the unbounded knapsack problem with bounded coefficients (UKPB). In order to increase the difficulty of solving these instances, the knapsack capacity $C$ is usually set to a very large value. Therefore, an exact algorithm that neither time complexity nor space complexity includes the capacity coefficient $C$ is highly anticipated. In this paper, we propose an exact algorithm with time complexity of $O(R^4)$ and space complexity of $O(R^3)$. The algorithm initially divides the multiset $N$ into two multisubsets, $N_1$ and $N_2$, based on the profit density of their types. For the multisubset $N_2$ composed of types with profit density lower than the maximum profit density type, we utilize a recent branch and bound (B\&B) result by Dey et al. (Math. Prog., pp 569-587, 2023) to determine the maximum selection number for types in $N_2$. We then employ the Unbounded-DP algorithm to exactly solve for the types in $N_2$. For the multisubset $N_1$ composed of the maximum profit density type and its counterparts with the same profit density, we transform it into a linear Diophantine equation and leverage relevant conclusions from the Frobenius problem to solve it efficiently. In particular, the proof techniques required by the algorithm are primarily covered in the first-year mathematics curriculum, which is convenient for subsequent researchers to grasp.</p></details> |  |
| **[An upper bound of the mutation probability in the genetic algorithm for general 0-1 knapsack problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11307v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important part of genetic algorithms (GAs), mutation operators is widely used in evolutionary algorithms to solve $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems because it can increase the population diversity of individual. Due to limitations in mathematical tools, the mutation probability of the mutation operator is primarily empirically set in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel reduction method for the 0-1 knapsack problem(0-1 KP) and an improved mutation operator (IMO) based on the assumption $\mathcal{NP}\neq\mathcal{P}$, along with the utilization of linear relaxation techniques and a recent result by Dey et al. (Math. Prog., pp 569-587, 2022). We employ this method to calculate an upper bound of the mutation probability in general instances of the 0-1 KP, and construct an instance where the mutation probability does not tend towards 0 as the problem size increases. Finally, we prove that the probability of the IMO hitting the optimal solution within only a single iteration in large-scale instances is superior to that of the traditional mutation operator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amplitude-Ensemble Quantum-Inspired Tabu Search Algorithm for Solving 0/1 Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12867v2)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, an improved version of QTS (Quantum-inspired Tabu Search) has been proposed, which enhances the utilization of population information, called "amplitude-ensemble" QTS (AE-QTS). This makes AE-QTS more similar to the real quantum search algorithm, Grover Search Algorithm, in abstract concept, while keeping the simplicity of the algorithm. Later, we demonstrate the AE-QTS on the classical combinatorial optimization 0/1 knapsack problem. Experimental results show that the AE-QTS outperforms other algorithms, including the QTS, by at least an average of 20% in all cases and even by 30% in some cases. Even as the problem complexity increases, the quality of the solutions found by our method remains superior to that of the QTS. These results prove that our method has better search performance.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Adversarial Knapsack and Secondary Effects of Common Information for Cyber Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10789v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variations of the Flip-It game have been applied to model network cyber operations. While Flip-It can accurately express uncertainty and loss of control, it imposes no essential resource constraints for operations. Capture the flag (CTF) style competitive games, such as Flip-It , entail uncertainties and loss of control, but also impose realistic constraints on resource use. As such, they bear a closer resemblance to actual cyber operations. We formalize a dynamical network control game for CTF competitions and detail the static game for each time step. The static game can be reformulated as instances of a novel optimization problem called Adversarial Knapsack (AK) or Dueling Knapsack (DK) when there are only two players. We define the Adversarial Knapsack optimization problems as a system of interacting Weighted Knapsack problems, and illustrate its applications to general scenarios involving multiple agents with conflicting optimization goals, e.g., cyber operations and CTF games in particular. Common awareness of the scenario, rewards, and costs will set the stage for a non-cooperative game. Critically, rational players may second guess that their AK solution -- with a better response and higher reward -- is possible if opponents predictably play their AK optimal solutions. Thus, secondary reasoning which such as belief modeling of opponents play can be anticipated for rational players and will introduce a type of non-stability where players maneuver for slight reward differentials. To analyze this, we provide the best-response algorithms and simulation software to consider how rational agents may heuristically search for maneuvers. We further summarize insights offered by the game model by predicting that metrics such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) may intensify the secondary reasoning in cyber operations.</p></details> | 26 pages |

We prove that this is almost optimal: We give a family of $n$-node graphs for which every polynomial-size MIP formulation requires $\Omega(n/\log^2 n)$ integer variables. By a polyhedral reduction we obtain an analogous result for $n$-item knapsack problems. In both cases, this improves the previously known bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ by Cevallos, Weltge & Zenklusen (SODA 2018). To this end, we show that there exists a family of $n$-node graphs whose stable set polytopes satisfy the following: any $(1+\varepsilon/n)$-approximate extended formulation for these polytopes, for some constant $\varepsilon > 0$, has size $2^{\Omega(n/\log n)}$. Our proof extends and simplifies the information-theoretic methods due to G\"o\"os, Jain & Watson (FOCS 2016, SIAM J. Comput. 2018) who showed the same result for the case of exact extended formulations (i.e. $\varepsilon = 0$).</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full paper of IPCO 2024 version</p></details> |

We introduce a continuous relaxation for the CKP, represented as a non-convex optimization problem, which we call the non-convex relaxation. A comparative study shows that the non-convex relaxation provides an upper bound for the CKP, at least as tight as those obtained from other continuous relaxations for the CKP. Furthermore, the quality of the obtained upper bound is guaranteed to be at most twice the optimal objective value of the CKP. Despite its non-convex nature, we show that the non-convex relaxation can be solved in polynomial time. Subsequently, we proposed a polynomial-time 1/2-approximation algorithm for the CKP based on this relaxation, providing a lower bound for the CKP. Computational test results demonstrate that the non-convex relaxation and the proposed approximation algorithm yields tight lower and upper bounds for the CKP within a short computation time, ensuring the quality of the obtained bounds.</p></details> |  |

| **[Differentially Private Algorithms for Graphs Under Continual Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14756v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private algorithms protect individuals in data analysis scenarios by ensuring that there is only a weak correlation between the existence of the user in the data and the result of the analysis. Dynamic graph algorithms maintain the solution to a problem (e.g., a matching) on an evolving input, i.e., a graph where nodes or edges are inserted or deleted over time. They output the value of the solution after each update operation, i.e., continuously. We study (event-level and user-level) differentially private algorithms for graph problems under continual observation, i.e., differentially private dynamic graph algorithms. We present event-level private algorithms for partially dynamic counting-based problems such as triangle count that improve the additive error by a polynomial factor (in the length $T$ of the update sequence) on the state of the art, resulting in the first algorithms with additive error polylogarithmic in $T$. We also give $\varepsilon$-differentially private and partially dynamic algorithms for minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, densest subgraph, and maximum matching. The additive error of our improved MST algorithm is $O(W \log^{3/2}T / \varepsilon)$, where $W$ is the maximum weight of any edge, which, as we show, is tight up to a $(\sqrt{\log T} / \varepsilon)$-factor. For the other problems, we present a partially-dynamic algorithm with multiplicative error $(1+\beta)$ for any constant $\beta > 0$ and additive error $O(W \log(nW) \log(T) / (\varepsilon \beta))$. Finally, we show that the additive error for a broad class of dynamic graph algorithms with user-level privacy must be linear in the value of the output solution's range.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected typos in lower bounds in Table 1.

| **[Cut-Query Algorithms with Few Rounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20412v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the cut-query model, the algorithm can access the input graph $G=(V,E)$ only via cut queries that report, given a set $S\subseteq V$, the total weight of edges crossing the cut between $S$ and $V\setminus S$. This model was introduced by Rubinstein, Schramm and Weinberg [ITCS'18] and its investigation has so far focused on the number of queries needed to solve optimization problems, such as global minimum cut. We turn attention to the round complexity of cut-query algorithms, and show that several classical problems can be solved in this model with only a constant number of rounds. Our main results are algorithms for finding a minimum cut in a graph, that offer different tradeoffs between round complexity and query complexity, where $n=|V|$ and $\delta(G)$ denotes the minimum degree of $G$: (i) $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ cut queries in two rounds in unweighted graphs; (ii) $\tilde{O}(rn^{1+1/r}/\delta(G)^{1/r})$ queries in $2r+1$ rounds for any integer $r\ge 1$ again in unweighted graphs; and (iii) $\tilde{O}(rn^{1+(1+\log_n W)/r})$ queries in $4r+3$ rounds for any $r\ge1$ in weighted graphs. We also provide algorithms that find a minimum $(s,t)$-cut and approximate the maximum cut in a few rounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Contractions of Dynamic Graphs -- with Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05157v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A non-trivial minimum cut (NMC) sparsifier is a multigraph $\hat{G}$ that preserves all non-trivial minimum cuts of a given undirected graph $G$. We introduce a flexible data structure for fully dynamic graphs that can efficiently provide an NMC sparsifier upon request at any point during the sequence of updates. We employ simple dynamic forest data structures to achieve a fast from-scratch construction of the sparsifier at query time. Based on the strength of the adversary and desired type of time bounds, the data structure comes with different guarantees. Specifically, let $G$ be a fully dynamic simple graph with $n$ vertices and minimum degree $\delta$. Then our data structure supports an insertion/deletion of an edge to/from $G$ in $n^{o(1)}$ worst-case time. Furthermore, upon request, it can return w.h.p. an NMC sparsifier of $G$ that has $O(n/\delta)$ vertices and $O(n)$ edges, in $\hat{O}(n)$ time. The probabilistic guarantees hold against an adaptive adversary. Alternatively, the update and query times can be improved to $\tilde{O}(1)$ and $\tilde{O}(n)$ respectively, if amortized-time guarantees are sufficient, or if the adversary is oblivious. We discuss two applications of our data structure. First, it can be used to efficiently report a cactus representation of all minimum cuts of a fully dynamic simple graph. Using the NMC sparsifier we can w.h.p. build this cactus in worst-case time $\hat{O}(n)$ against an adaptive adversary. Second, our data structure allows us to efficiently compute the maximal $k$-edge-connected subgraphs of undirected simple graphs, by repeatedly applying a minimum cut algorithm on the NMC sparsifier. Specifically, we can compute w.h.p. the maximal $k$-edge-connected subgraphs of a simple graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges in $\tilde{O}(m+n^2/k)$ time which is an improvement for $k = \Omega(n^{1/8})$ and works for fully dynamic graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Min cost flow on unit capacity networks and convex cost K-flow are as easy as the assignment problem with All-Min-Cuts algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04012v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore here surprising links between the time-cost-tradeoff problem and the minimum cost flow problem that lead to fast, strongly polynomial, algorithms for both problems. One of the main results is a new algorithm for the unit capacity min cost flow that matches the complexity of the fastest strongly polynomial algorithm known for the assignment problem. The time cost tradeoff (TCT) problem in project management is to expedite the durations of activities, subject to precedence constraints, in order to achieve a target project completion time at minimum expediting costs, or, to maximize the net benefit from a reward associated with project completion time reduction. Each activity is associated with integer normal duration, minimum duration, and expediting cost per unit reduction in duration. We devise here the {\em all-min-cuts} procedure, which for a given maximum flow, is capable of generating all minimum cuts (equivalent to minimum cost expediting) of equal value very efficiently. Equivalently, the procedure identifies all solutions that reside on the TCT curve between consecutive breakpoints in average $O(m+n \log n)$ time, where $m$ and $n$ are the numbers of arcs and nodes in the network. The all-min-cuts procedure implies faster algorithms for certain TCT problems and for certain min cost flow problem with a significantly different approach from the ones known.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Charging for Half-Integral TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17999v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the max entropy algorithm is a randomized 1.49776 approximation for half-integral TSP, improving upon the previous known bound of 1.49993 from Karlin et al. This also improves upon the best-known approximation for half-integral TSP due to Gupta et al. Our improvement results from using the dual, instead of the primal, to analyze the expected cost of the matching. We believe this method of analysis could lead to a simpler proof that max entropy is a better-than-3/2 approximation in the general case. We also give a 1.4671 approximation for half integral LP solutions with no proper minimum cuts and an even number of vertices, improving upon the bound of Haddadan and Newman of 1.476. We then extend the analysis to the case when there are an odd number of vertices $n$ at the cost of an additional $O(1/n)$ factor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Algorithms for Graph Arboricity and Related Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15598v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give an algorithm for finding the arboricity of a weighted, undirected graph, defined as the minimum number of spanning forests that cover all edges of the graph, in $\sqrt{n} m^{1+o(1)}$ time. This improves on the previous best bound of $\tilde{O}(nm)$ for weighted graphs and $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2}) $ for unweighted graphs (Gabow 1995) for this problem. The running time of our algorithm is dominated by a logarithmic number of calls to a directed global minimum cut subroutine -- if the running time of the latter problem improves to $m^{1+o(1)}$ (thereby matching the running time of maximum flow), the running time of our arboricity algorithm would improve further to $m^{1+o(1)}$. We also give a new algorithm for computing the entire cut hierarchy -- laminar multiway cuts with minimum cut ratio in recursively defined induced subgraphs -- in $m n^{1+o(1)}$ time. The cut hierarchy yields the ideal edge loads (Thorup 2001) in a fractional spanning tree packing of the graph which, we show, also corresponds to a max-entropy solution in the spanning tree polytope. For the cut hierarchy problem, the previous best bound was $\tilde{O}(n^2 m)$ for weighted graphs and $\tilde{O}(n m^{3/2})$ for unweighted graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>FOCS ...</summary><p>FOCS 2025. 25 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Bicriteria Polygon Aggregation with Arbitrary Shapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11212v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of aggregating polygons by covering them with disjoint representative regions, thereby inducing a clustering of the polygons. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the total area and the total perimeter of the regions. This problem has applications in cartographic map generalization and urban analytics. Here, the polygons represent building footprints and the clusters may represent urban areas. Previous approaches forced the boundaries of the regions to come from a fixed subdivision of the plane, which allows the optimal solution (restricted in this way) to be found from a minimum cut in a dual graph. It is natural to ask whether the problem can still be solved efficiently if this restriction is removed, allowing output regions to be bounded by arbitrary curves. We provide a positive answer in the form of a polynomial-time algorithm. Additionally, we fully characterize the optimal solutions by showing that their boundaries are composed of input polygon edges and circular arcs of constant radius. Since some applications favor straight edges, we also study two problem variants in which the output regions must be polygons, but are not restricted to have boundaries from a fixed subdivision. In the first variant, region vertices must lie on the boundaries of the input polygons. The second variant requires them to be vertices of the input polygons. We show that both variants can be approximated up to a constant factor in polynomial time by altering an optimal solution for the unrestricted problem. Our experimental evaluation on real-world building footprints demonstrates that these approximate solutions are visually similar to the optimal unrestricted ones and achieve near-optimal objective values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating the Held-Karp Bound for Metric TSP in Nearly Linear Work and Polylogarithmic Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14745v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a nearly linear work parallel algorithm for approximating the Held-Karp bound for the Metric TSP problem. Given an edge-weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ on $m$ edges and $\epsilon>0$, it returns a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the Held-Karp bound with high probability, in $\tilde{O}(m/\epsilon^4)$ work and $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ depth. While a nearly linear time sequential algorithm was known for almost a decade (Chekuri and Quanrud'17), it was not known how to simultaneously achieve nearly linear work alongside polylogarithmic depth. Using a reduction by Chalermsook et al.'22, we also give a parallel algorithm for computing a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate fractional solution to the $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph (kECSS) problem, with similar complexity. To obtain these results, we introduce a notion of core-sequences for the parallel Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) framework (Luby-Nisan'93, Young'01). For the Metric TSP and kECSS problems, core-sequences enable us to exploit the structure of approximate minimum cuts to reduce the cost per iteration and/or the number of iterations. The acceleration technique via core-sequences is generic and of independent interest. In particular, it improves the best-known iteration complexity of MWU algorithms for packing/covering LPs from $poly(\log nnz(A))$ to polylogarithmic in the product of cardinalities of the core-sequence sets, where $A$ is the constraint matrix of the LP. For certain implicitly defined LPs such as the kECSS LP, this yields an exponential improvement in depth.</p></details> |  |
