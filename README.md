| **[Improved Approximation Algorithms for Three-Dimensional Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19365v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the three-dimensional Knapsack (3DK) problem, in which we are given a set of axis-aligned cuboids with associated profits and an axis-aligned cube knapsack. The objective is to find a non-overlapping axis-aligned packing (by translation) of the maximum profit subset of cuboids into the cube. The previous best approximation algorithm is due to Diedrich, Harren, Jansen, Th\"{o}le, and Thomas (2008), who gave a $(7+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for 3DK and a $(5+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the variant when the items can be rotated by 90 degrees around any axis, for any constant $\varepsilon>0$. Chleb\'{\i}k and Chleb\'{\i}kov\'{a} (2009) showed that the problem does not admit an asymptotic polynomial-time approximation scheme. We provide an improved polynomial-time $(139/29+\varepsilon) \approx 4.794$-approximation algorithm for 3DK and $(30/7+\varepsilon) \approx 4.286$-approximation when rotations by 90 degrees are allowed. We also provide improved approximation algorithms for several variants such as the cardinality case (when all items have the same profit) and uniform profit-density case (when the profit of an item is equal to its volume). Our key technical contribution is container packing -- a structured packing in 3D such that all items are assigned into a constant number of containers, and each container is packed using a specific strategy based on its type. We first show the existence of highly profitable container packings. Thereafter, we show that one can find near-optimal container packing efficiently using a variant of the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP).</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Bandwidth Observation Sharing for Multi-Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Intelligent Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09975v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation is increasingly crucial in various domains, including disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse and manufacturing automation. Robot teams often must operate in highly dynamic environments and under strict bandwidth constraints imposed by communication infrastructure, rendering effective observation sharing within the system a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel optimal communication scheme, Intelligent Knapsack (iKnap), for multi-robot navigation in dynamic environments under bandwidth constraints. We model multi-robot communication as belief propagation in a graph of inferential agents. We then formulate the combinatorial optimization for observation sharing as a 0/1 knapsack problem, where each potential pairwise communication between robots is assigned a decision-making utility to be weighed against its bandwidth cost, and the system has some cumulative bandwidth limit. We evaluate our approach in a simulated robotic warehouse with human workers using ROS2 and the Open Robotics Middleware Framework. Compared to state-of-the-art broadcast-based optimal communication schemes, iKnap yields significant improvements in navigation performance with respect to scenario complexity while maintaining a similar runtime. Furthermore, iKnap utilizes allocated bandwidth and observational resources more efficiently than existing approaches, especially in very low-resource and high-uncertainty settings. Based on these results, we claim that the proposed method enables more robust collaboration for multi-robot teams in real-world navigation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sum-Of-Squares To Approximate Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13292v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>These notes give a self-contained exposition of Karlin, Mathieu and Nguyen's tight estimate of the integrality gap of the sum-of-squares semidefinite program for solving the knapsack problem. They are based on a sequence of three lectures in CMU course on Advanced Approximation Algorithms in Fall'21 that used the KMN result to introduce the Sum-of-Squares method for algorithm design. The treatment in these notes uses the pseudo-distribution view of solutions to the sum-of-squares SDPs and only rely on a few basic, reusable results about pseudo-distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knapsack Optimization-based Schema Linking for LLM-based Text-to-SQL Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12911v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating SQLs from user queries is a long-standing challenge, where the accuracy of initial schema linking significantly impacts subsequent SQL generation performance. However, current schema linking models still struggle with missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial reason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to capture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking performance. Motivated by this, we propose an enhanced schema linking metric by introducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack optimization-based Schema Linking Agent (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking agent designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while minimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical linking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and subsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking candidate space. In each linking process, it utilize a knapsack optimization approach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited tolerance of potential redundant ones.With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B achieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs, including deepseek-v3 with state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method. Extensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can significantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA text-to-SQL models by substituting their schema linking processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative-enhanced optimization for knapsack problems: an industry-relevant study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04928v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is a crucial task in various industries such as logistics, aviation, manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and insurance, where finding the best solution to a problem can result in significant cost savings and increased efficiency. Tensor networks (TNs) have gained prominence in recent years in modeling classical systems with quantum-inspired approaches. More recently, TN generative-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) has been proposed as a strategy which uses generative modeling to efficiently sample valid solutions with respect to certain constraints of optimization problems. Moreover, it has been shown that symmetric TNs (STNs) can encode certain constraints of optimization problems, thus aiding in their solution process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of TN- and STN-GEO to an industry relevant problem class, a multi-knapsack problem, in which each object must be assigned to an available knapsack. We detail a prescription for practitioners to use the TN-and STN-GEO methodology and study its scaling behavior and dependence on its hyper-parameters. We benchmark 60 different problem instances and find that TN-GEO and STN-GEO produce results of similar quality to simulated annealing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bandits with Anytime Knapsacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18560v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider bandits with anytime knapsacks (BwAK), a novel version of the BwK problem where there is an \textit{anytime} cost constraint instead of a total cost budget. This problem setting introduces additional complexities as it mandates adherence to the constraint throughout the decision-making process. We propose SUAK, an algorithm that utilizes upper confidence bounds to identify the optimal mixture of arms while maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation. SUAK is an adaptive algorithm that strategically utilizes the available budget in each round in the decision-making process and skips a round when it is possible to violate the anytime cost constraint. In particular, SUAK slightly under-utilizes the available cost budget to reduce the need for skipping rounds. We show that SUAK attains the same problem-dependent regret upper bound of $ O(K \log T)$ established in prior work under the simpler BwK framework. Finally, we provide simulations to verify the utility of SUAK in practical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Nearly Quadratic-Time FPTAS for Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07821v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the classic Knapsack problem and propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) that runs in $\widetilde{O}(n + (1/\varepsilon)^2)$ time. This improves upon the $\widetilde{O}(n + (1/\varepsilon)^{11/5})$-time algorithm by Deng, Jin, and Mao [\textit{Proceedings of the 2023 Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2023}]. Our algorithm is the best possible (up to a polylogarithmic factor) conditioned on the conjecture that $(\min, +)$-convolution has no truly subquadratic-time algorithm, since this conjecture implies that Knapsack has no $O((n + 1/\varepsilon)^{2-\delta})$-time FPTAS for any constant $\delta > 0$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Firefly-Genetic Algorithm for Single and Multi-dimensional 0-1 Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14775v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges faced by algorithms, such as the Firefly Algorithm (FA) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), in constrained optimization problems. While both algorithms perform well for unconstrained problems, their effectiveness diminishes when constraints are introduced due to limitations in exploration, exploitation, and constraint handling. To overcome these challenges, a hybrid FAGA algorithm is proposed, combining the strengths of both algorithms. The hybrid algorithm is validated by solving unconstrained benchmark functions and constrained optimization problems, including design engineering problems and combinatorial problems such as the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. The proposed algorithm delivers improved solution accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional optimization algorithm. This paper outlines the development and structure of the hybrid algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness in handling complex optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation Schemes for Geometric Knapsack for Packing Spheres and Fat Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03981v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the geometric knapsack problem in which we are given a set of $d$-dimensional objects (each with associated profits) and the goal is to find the maximum profit subset that can be packed non-overlappingly into a given $d$-dimensional (unit hypercube) knapsack. Even if $d=2$ and all input objects are disks, this problem is known to be \textsf{NP}-hard [Demaine, Fekete, Lang, 2010]. In this paper, we give polynomial time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the following types of input objects in any constant dimension $d$: - disks and hyperspheres, - a class of fat convex polygons that generalizes regular $k$-gons for $k\ge 5$ (formally, polygons with a constant number of edges, whose lengths are in a bounded range, and in which each angle is strictly larger than $\pi/2$), - arbitrary fat convex objects that are sufficiently small compared to the knapsack. We remark that in our \textsf{PTAS} for disks and hyperspheres, we output the computed set of objects, but for a $O_\varepsilon(1)$ of them, we determine their coordinates only up to an exponentially small error. However, it is unclear whether there always exists a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution that uses only rational coordinates for the disks' centers. We leave this as an open problem that is related to well-studied geometric questions in the realm of circle packing.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of the work appeared in the proceedings of the 51st EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP) 2024</p></details> |
| **[The complexity of knapsack problems in wreath products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08086v2)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove new complexity results for computational problems in certain wreath products of groups and (as an application) for free solvable group. For a finitely generated group we study the so-called power word problem (does a given expression $u_1^{k_1} \ldots u_d^{k_d}$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d$ are words over the group generators and $k_1, \ldots, k_d$ are binary encoded integers, evaluate to the group identity?) and knapsack problem (does a given equation $u_1^{x_1} \ldots u_d^{x_d} = v$, where $u_1, \ldots, u_d,v$ are words over the group generators and $x_1,\ldots,x_d$ are variables, has a solution in the natural numbers). We prove that the power word problem for wreath products of the form $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$ with $G$ nilpotent and iterated wreath products of free abelian groups belongs to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. As an application of the latter, the power word problem for free solvable groups is in $\mathsf{TC}^0$. On the other hand we show that for wreath products $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is a so called uniformly strongly efficiently non-solvable group (which form a large subclass of non-solvable groups), the power word problem is $\mathsf{coNP}$-hard. For the knapsack problem we show $\mathsf{NP}$-completeness for iterated wreath products of free abelian groups and hence free solvable groups. Moreover, the knapsack problem for every wreath product $G \wr \mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is uniformly efficiently non-solvable, is $\Sigma^2_p$-hard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation Algorithms for Correlated Knapsack Orienteering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16566v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the {\em correlated knapsack orienteering} (CSKO) problem: we are given a travel budget $B$, processing-time budget $W$, finite metric space $(V,d)$ with root $\rho\in V$, where each vertex is associated with a job with possibly correlated random size and random reward that become known only when the job completes. Random variables are independent across different vertices. The goal is to compute a $\rho$-rooted path of length at most $B$, in a possibly adaptive fashion, that maximizes the reward collected from jobs that are processed by time $W$. To our knowledge, CSKO has not been considered before, though prior work has considered the uncorrelated problem, {\em stochastic knapsack orienteering}, and {\em correlated orienteering}, which features only one budget constraint on the {\em sum} of travel-time and processing-times. We show that the {\em adaptivity gap of CSKO is not a constant, and is at least $\Omega\bigl(\max\sqrt{\log{B}},\sqrt{\log\log{W}}\}\bigr)$}. Complementing this, we devise {\em non-adaptive} algorithms that obtain: (a) $O(\log\log W)$-approximation in quasi-polytime; and (b) $O(\log W)$-approximation in polytime. We obtain similar guarantees for CSKO with cancellations, wherein a job can be cancelled before its completion time, foregoing its reward. We also consider the special case of CSKO, wherein job sizes are weighted Bernoulli distributions, and more generally where the distributions are supported on at most two points (2-CSKO). Although weighted Bernoulli distributions suffice to yield an $\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log B})$ adaptivity-gap lower bound for (uncorrelated) {\em stochastic orienteering}, we show that they are easy instances for CSKO. We develop non-adaptive algorithms that achieve $O(1)$-approximation in polytime for weighted Bernoulli distributions, and in $(n+\log B)^{O(\log W)}$-time for the more general case of 2-CSKO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of APPROX 2024 paper</p></details> |
| **[Shadoks Approach to Knapsack Polygonal Packing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20123v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2024 edition of the CG:SHOP Challenge focused on the knapsack polygonal packing problem. Each instance consists of a convex polygon known as the container and a multiset of items, where each item is a simple polygon with an associated integer value. A feasible packing solution places a selection of the items inside the container without overlapping and using only translations. The goal is to achieve a packing that maximizes the total value of the items in the solution. Our approach to win first place is divided into two main steps. First, we generate promising initial solutions using two strategies: one based on integer linear programming and the other on employing a combination of geometric greedy heuristics. In the second step, we enhance these solutions through local search techniques, which involve repositioning items and exploring potential replacements to improve the total value of the packing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Unbounded Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02045v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the competitive ratio and the advice complexity of the online unbounded knapsack problem. An instance is given as a sequence of n items with a size and a value each, and an algorithm has to decide how often to pack each item into a knapsack of bounded capacity. The items are given online and the total size of the packed items must not exceed the knapsack's capacity, while the objective is to maximize the total value of the packed items. While each item can only be packed once in the classical 0-1 knapsack problem, the unbounded version allows for items to be packed multiple times. We show that the simple unbounded knapsack problem, where the size of each item is equal to its value, allows for a competitive ratio of 2. We also analyze randomized algorithms and show that, in contrast to the 0-1 knapsack problem, one uniformly random bit cannot improve an algorithm's performance. More randomness lowers the competitive ratio to less than 1.736, but it can never be below 1.693. In the advice complexity setting, we measure how many bits of information the algorithm has to know to achieve some desired solution quality. For the simple unbounded knapsack problem, one advice bit lowers the competitive ratio to 3/2. While this cannot be improved with fewer than log(n) advice bits for instances of length n, a competitive ratio of 1+epsilon can be achieved with O(log(n/epsilon)/epsilon) advice bits for any epsilon>0. We further show that no amount of advice bounded by a function f(n) allows an algorithm to be optimal. We also study the online general unbounded knapsack problem and show that it does not allow for any bounded competitive ratio for deterministic and randomized algorithms, as well as for algorithms using fewer than log(n) advice bits. We also provide an algorithm that uses O(log(n/epsilon)/epsilon) advice bits to achieve a competitive ratio of 1+epsilon for any epsilon>0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximately Counting Knapsack Solutions in Subquadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22267v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the classic #Knapsack problem, which asks to count the Boolean points $(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\{0,1\}^n$ in a given half-space $\sum_{i=1}^nW_ix_i\le T$. This #P-complete problem admits $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation. Before this work, [Dyer, STOC 2003]'s $\tilde{O}(n^{2.5}+n^2{\epsilon^{-2}})$-time randomized approximation scheme remains the fastest known in the natural regime of $\epsilon\ge 1/polylog(n)$. In this paper, we give a randomized $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm in $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}{\epsilon^{-2}})$ time (in the standard word-RAM model), achieving the first sub-quadratic dependence on $n$. Such sub-quadratic running time is rare in the approximate counting literature in general, as a large class of algorithms naturally faces a quadratic-time barrier. Our algorithm follows Dyer's framework, which reduces #Knapsack to the task of sampling (and approximately counting) solutions in a randomly rounded instance with poly(n)-bounded integer weights. We refine Dyer's framework using the following ideas: - We decrease the sample complexity of Dyer's Monte Carlo method, by proving some structural lemmas for typical points near the input hyperplane via hitting-set arguments, and appropriately setting the rounding scale. - Instead of running a vanilla dynamic program on the rounded instance, we employ techniques from the growing field of pseudopolynomial-time Subset Sum algorithms, such as FFT, divide-and-conquer, and balls-into-bins hashing of [Bringmann, SODA 2017]. We also need other ingredients, including a surprising application of the recent Bounded Monotone (max,+)-Convolution algorithm by [Chi-Duan-Xie-Zhang, STOC 2022] (adapted by [Bringmann-D\"urr-Polak, ESA 2024]), the notion of sum-approximation from [Gawrychowski-Markin-Weimann, ICALP 2018]'s #Knapsack approximation scheme, and a two-phase extension of Dyer's framework for handling tiny weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SODA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Maximizing a Submodular Function with Bounded Curvature under an Unknown Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09668v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under an unknown knapsack constraint. A solution to this problem is a policy that decides which item to pack next based on the past packing history. The robustness factor of a policy is the worst case ratio of the solution obtained by following the policy and an optimal solution that knows the knapsack capacity. We develop a policy with a robustness factor that is decreasing in the curvature $c$ of the submodular function. For the extreme cases $c=0$ corresponding to an additive objective function, it matches a previously known and best possible robustness factor of $1/2$. For the other extreme case of $c=1$ it yields a robustness factor of $\approx 0.35$ improving over the best previously known robustness factor of $\approx 0.06$. The analysis of our policy relies on a greedy algorithm that is a slight modification of Wolsey's greedy algorithm for the submodular knapsack problem with a known knapsack constraint. We obtain tight approximation guarantees for both of these algorithms in the setting of a submodular objective function with curvature $c$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Packing a Knapsack with Items Owned by Strategic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06080v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a scenario within the field of mechanism design without money where a mechanism designer is interested in selecting items with maximum total value under a knapsack constraint. The items, however, are controlled by strategic agents who aim to maximize the total value of their items in the knapsack. This is a natural setting, e.g., when agencies select projects for funding, companies select products for sale in their shops, or hospitals schedule MRI scans for the day. A mechanism governing the packing of the knapsack is strategyproof if no agent can benefit from hiding items controlled by them to the mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that are strategyproof and $\alpha$-approximate in the sense that they always approximate the maximum value of the knapsack by a factor of $\alpha \in [0,1]$. First, we give a deterministic mechanism that is $\frac{1}{3}$-approximate. For the special case where all items have unit density, we design a $\frac{1}{\phi}$-approximate mechanism where $1/\phi \approx 0.618$ is the inverse of the golden ratio. This result is tight as we show that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism with a better approximation exists. We further give randomized mechanisms with approximation guarantees of $1/2$ for the general case and $2/3$ for the case of unit densities. For both cases, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve an approximation guarantee better than $1/(5\phi -7)\approx 0.917$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knapsack with Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Hitting Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01057v4)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, with vertex weights $(w(u))_{u\in\mathcal{V}}$, vertex values $(\alpha(u))_{u\in\mathcal{V}}$, a knapsack size $s$, and a target value $d$, the \vcknapsack problem is to determine if there exists a subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathcal{V}$ of vertices such that $\mathcal{U}$ forms a vertex cover, $w(\mathcal{U})=\sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}} w(u) \le s$, and $\alpha(\mathcal{U})=\sum_{u\in\mathcal{U}} \alpha(u) \ge d$. In this paper, we closely study the \vcknapsack problem and its variations, such as \vcknapsackbudget, \minimalvcknapsack, and \minimumvcknapsack, for both general graphs and trees. We first prove that the \vcknapsack problem belongs to the complexity class \NPC and then study the complexity of the other variations. We generalize the problem to \setc and \hs versions and design polynomial time $H_g$-factor approximation algorithm for the \setckp problem and d-factor approximation algorithm for \hstp using primal dual method. We further show that \setcks and \hsmb are hard to approximate in polynomial time. Additionally, we develop a fixed parameter tractable algorithm running in time $8^{\mathcal{O}({\rm tw})}\cdot n\cdot {\sf min}\{s,d\}$ where ${\rm tw},s,d,n$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, the size of the knapsack, the target value of the knapsack, and the number of items for the \minimalvcknapsack problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Competitive Ratio of Threshold Policies for Online Unit-density Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08735v3)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a supply chain ordering problem faced by a wholesale supplier serving unpredictable demand. In this problem, the supplier has an initial stock, and faces a stream of orders for different amounts that are unknown a priori. Each order must be either accepted or rejected immediately, and must respect the knapsack constraint, that is, an order is only acceptable if its amount can be fully served by the remaining stock. The objective is to maximize the total stock spent serving orders. We investigate randomized threshold algorithms that accept an item as long as its size exceeds the threshold. We derive two optimal threshold distributions, the first is 0.4324-competitive relative to the optimal offline integral packing, and the second is 0.4285-competitive relative to the optimal offline fractional packing. Both results require optimizing the cumulative distribution function of the random threshold, which are challenging infinite-dimensional optimization problems. We also consider the generalization to multiple knapsacks, where an arriving item has a different size in each knapsack and must be placed in at most one knapsack. We derive a 0.2142-competitive algorithm for this problem. We also show that any randomized algorithm for this problem cannot be more than 0.4605-competitive. This is the first upper bound strictly less than 0.5, which implies the intrinsic challenge of knapsack constraint. We show how to naturally implement our optimal threshold distributions in the warehouses of a Latin American chain department store. We run simulations on their order data, which demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Parallel Algorithm for Non-Monotone Submodular Maximization under Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04415v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes an efficient parallel algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint problem over the ground set of size $n$. Our algorithm improves the best approximation factor of the existing parallel one from $8+\epsilon$ to $7+\epsilon$ with $O(\log n)$ adaptive complexity. The key idea of our approach is to create a new alternate threshold algorithmic framework. This strategy alternately constructs two disjoint candidate solutions within a constant number of sequence rounds. Then, the algorithm boosts solution quality without sacrificing the adaptive complexity. Extensive experimental studies on three applications, Revenue Maximization, Image Summarization, and Maximum Weighted Cut, show that our algorithm not only significantly increases solution quality but also requires comparative adaptivity to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the Thirty-Third International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), Main Track</p></details> |
| **[Bounding the Price-of-Fair-Sharing using Knapsack-Cover Constraints to guide Near-Optimal Cost-Recovery Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16914v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of fairly allocating the cost of providing a service among a set of users, where the service cost is formulated by an NP-hard {\it covering integer program (CIP)}. The central issue is to determine a cost allocation to each user that, in total, recovers as much as possible of the actual cost while satisfying a stabilizing condition known as the {\it core property}. The ratio between the total service cost and the cost recovered from users has been studied previously, with seminal papers of Deng, Ibaraki, \& Nagomochi and Goemans \& Skutella linking this {\it price-of-fair-sharing} to the integrality gap of an associated LP relaxation. Motivated by an application of cost allocation for network design for LPWANs, an emerging IoT technology, we investigate a general class of CIPs and give the first non-trivial price-of-fair-sharing bounds by using the natural LP relaxation strengthened with knapsack-cover inequalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these LP-based methods outperform previously known methods on an LPWAN-derived CIP data set. We also obtain analogous results for a more general setting in which the service provider also gets to select the subset of users, and the mechanism to elicit users' private utilities should be group-strategyproof. The key to obtaining this result is a simplified and improved analysis for a cross-monotone cost-allocation mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper appearing in proceedings of WAOA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fine Grained Lower Bounds for Multidimensional Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10146v1)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the $d$-dimensional knapsack problem. We are given a set of items, each with a $d$-dimensional cost vector and a profit, along with a $d$-dimensional budget vector. The goal is to select a set of items that do not exceed the budget in all dimensions and maximize the total profit. A PTAS with running time $n^{\Theta(d/\varepsilon)}$ has long been known for this problem, where $\varepsilon$ is the error parameter and $n$ is the encoding size. Despite decades of active research, the best running time of a PTAS has remained $O(n^{\lceil d/\varepsilon \rceil - d})$. Unfortunately, existing lower bounds only cover the special case with two dimensions $d = 2$, and do not answer whether there is a $n^{o(d/\varepsilon)}$-time PTAS for larger values of $d$. The status of exact algorithms is similar: there is a simple $O(n \cdot W^d)$-time (exact) dynamic programming algorithm, where $W$ is the maximum budget, but there is no lower bound which explains the strong exponential dependence on $d$. In this work, we show that the running times of the best-known PTAS and exact algorithm cannot be improved up to a polylogarithmic factor assuming Gap-ETH. Our techniques are based on a robust reduction from 2-CSP, which embeds 2-CSP constraints into a desired number of dimensions, exhibiting tight trade-off between $d$ and $\varepsilon$ for most regimes of the parameters. Informally, we obtain the following main results for $d$-dimensional knapsack. No $n^{o(d/\varepsilon \cdot 1/(\log(d/\varepsilon))^2)}$-time $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation for every $\varepsilon = O(1/\log d)$. No $(n+W)^{o(d/\log d)}$-time exact algorithm (assuming ETH). No $n^{o(\sqrt{d})}$-time $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation for constant $\varepsilon$. $(d \cdot \log W)^{O(d^2)} + n^{O(1)}$-time $\Omega(1/\sqrt{d})$-approximation and a matching $n^{O(1)}$-time lower~bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Practical Benchmarks of Ising Machines: A Case Study on the Quadratic Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19175v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization has wide applications from industry to natural science. Ising machines bring an emerging computing paradigm for efficiently solving a combinatorial optimization problem by searching a ground state of a given Ising model. Current cutting-edge Ising machines achieve fast sampling of near-optimal solutions of the max-cut problem. However, for problems with additional constraint conditions, their advantages have been hardly shown due to difficulties in handling the constraints. In this work, we focus on benchmarks of Ising machines on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To bring out their practical performance, we propose fast two-stage post-processing for Ising machines, which makes handling the constraint easier. Simulation based on simulated annealing shows that the proposed method substantially improves the solving performance of Ising machines and the improvement is robust to a choice of encoding of the constraint condition. Through evaluation using an Ising machine called Amplify Annealing Engine, the proposed method is shown to dramatically improve its solving performance on the QKP. These results are a crucial step toward showing advantages of Ising machines on practical problems involving various constraint conditions.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Provably Good Solutions to the Knapsack Problem via Neural Networks of Bounded Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14105v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of a satisfying and rigorous mathematical understanding of the performance of neural networks is a major challenge in artificial intelligence. Against this background, we study the expressive power of neural networks through the example of the classical NP-hard Knapsack Problem. Our main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with rectified linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a Knapsack instance and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. We show that an RNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum Knapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions. We also prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of the computed Knapsack solution: for Knapsack instances consisting of $n$ items, an RNN of depth five and width $w$ computes a solution of value at least $1-\mathcal{O}(n^2/\sqrt{w})$ times the optimum solution value. Our results build upon a classical dynamic programming formulation of the Knapsack Problem as well as a careful rounding of profit values that are also at the core of the well-known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Knapsack Problem. A carefully conducted computational study qualitatively supports our theoretical size bounds. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized to many other combinatorial optimization problems that admit dynamic programming solution methods, such as various Shortest Path Problems, the Longest Common Subsequence Problem, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors' accepted manuscript for the INFORMS Journal on Computing.

| **[A Re-solving Heuristic for Dynamic Assortment Optimization with Knapsack Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05564v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization highly non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Efficient Knapsack Optimization Using Probabilistic Memristor Crossbars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04332v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained optimization underlies crucial societal problems (for instance, stock trading and bandwidth allocation), but is often computationally hard (complexity grows exponentially with problem size). The big-data era urgently demands low-latency and low-energy optimization at the edge, which cannot be handled by digital processors due to their non-parallel von Neumann architecture. Recent efforts using massively parallel hardware (such as memristor crossbars and quantum processors) employing annealing algorithms, while promising, have handled relatively easy and stable problems with sparse or binary representations (such as the max-cut or traveling salesman problems).However, most real-world applications embody three features, which are encoded in the knapsack problem, and cannot be handled by annealing algorithms - dense and non-binary representations, with destabilizing self-feedback. Here we demonstrate a post-digital-hardware-friendly randomized competitive Ising-inspired (RaCI) algorithm performing knapsack optimization, experimentally implemented on a foundry-manufactured CMOS-integrated probabilistic analog memristor crossbar. Our solution outperforms digital and quantum approaches by over 4 orders of magnitude in energy efficiency.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

This improves over the $\widetilde{O}(n + t \, p_{\max})$-time algorithm based on the convolution and prediction technique by Bateni et al.~(STOC 2018). Moreover, we give some evidence, based on a strengthening of the Min-Plus Convolution Hypothesis, that our running time might be optimal. Our algorithm uses two new technical tools, which might be of independent interest. First, we generalize the $\widetilde{O}(n^{1.5})$-time algorithm for bounded monotone min-plus convolution by Chi et al.~(STOC 2022) to the \emph{rectangular} case where the range of entries can be different from the sequence length. Second, we give a reduction from general knapsack instances to \emph{balanced} instances, where all items have nearly the same profit-to-weight ratio, up to a constant factor. Using these techniques, we can also obtain algorithms that run in time $\widetilde{O}(n + OPT\sqrt{w_{\max}})$, $\widetilde{O}(n + (nw_{\max}p_{\max})^{1/3}t^{2/3})$, and $\widetilde{O}(n + (nw_{\max}p_{\max})^{1/3} OPT^{2/3})$, where $OPT$ is the optimal total profit and $w_{\max}$ is the maximum item weight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competitive Algorithms for Online Knapsack with Succinct Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18752v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the online knapsack problem, the goal is to pack items arriving online with different values and weights into a capacity-limited knapsack to maximize the total value of the accepted items. We study \textit{learning-augmented} algorithms for this problem, which aim to use machine-learned predictions to move beyond pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Existing learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack consider relatively complicated prediction models that give an algorithm substantial information about the input, such as the total weight of items at each value. In practice, such predictions can be error-sensitive and difficult to learn. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a family of learning-augmented algorithms for online knapsack that use \emph{succinct predictions}. In particular, the machine-learned prediction given to the algorithm is just a single value or interval that estimates the minimum value of any item accepted by an offline optimal solution. By leveraging a relaxation to online \emph{fractional} knapsack, we design algorithms that can leverage such succinct predictions in both the trusted setting (i.e., with perfect prediction) and the untrusted setting, where we prove that a simple meta-algorithm achieves a nearly optimal consistency-robustness trade-off. Empirically, we show that our algorithms significantly outperform baselines that do not use predictions and often outperform algorithms based on more complex prediction models.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[An EPTAS for Cardinality Constrained Multiple Knapsack via Iterative Randomized Rounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12622v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In [Math. Oper. Res., 2011], Fleischer et al. introduced a powerful technique for solving the generic class of separable assignment problems (SAP), in which a set of items of given values and weights needs to be packed into a set of bins subject to separable assignment constraints, so as to maximize the total value. The approach of Fleischer at al. relies on solving a configuration LP and sampling a configuration for each bin independently based on the LP solution. While there is a SAP variant for which this approach yields the best possible approximation ratio, for various special cases, there are discrepancies between the approximation ratios obtained using the above approach and the state-of-the-art approximations. This raises the following natural question: Can we do better by iteratively solving the configuration LP and sampling a few bins at a time? To assess the potential gain from iterative randomized rounding, we consider as a case study one interesting SAP variant, namely, Uniform Cardinality Constrained Multiple Knapsack, for which we answer this question affirmatively. The input is a set of items, each has a value and a weight, and a set of uniform capacity bins. The goal is to assign a subset of the items of maximum total value to the bins such that $(i)$ the capacity of any bin is not exceeded, and $(ii)$ the number of items assigned to each bin satisfies a given cardinality constraint. While the technique of Fleischer et al. yields a $\left(1-\frac{1}{e}\right)$-approximation for the problem, we show that iterative randomized rounding leads to an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS), thus essentially resolving the complexity status of the problem. Our analysis of iterative randomized rounding can be useful for solving other SAP variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding and Exploring Promising Search Space for the 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03918v3)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with many engineering applications. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm combining evolutionary computation with the exact algorithm to solve the 0-1 MKP. It maintains a set of solutions and utilizes the information from the population to extract good partial assignments. To find high-quality solutions, an exact algorithm is applied to explore the promising search space specified by the good partial assignments. The new solutions are used to update the population. Thus, the good partial assignments evolve towards a better direction with the improvement of the population. Extensive experimentation with commonly used benchmark sets shows that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms, TPTEA and DQPSO, as well as the commercial solver CPlex. It finds better solutions than the existing algorithms and provides new lower bounds for 10 large and hard instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized heuristic repair for large-scale multidimensional knapsack problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15569v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem whose solution is determining a subset of maximum total profit items that do not violate capacity constraints. Due to its hardness, large-scale MKP instances are usually a target for metaheuristics, a context in which effective feasibility maintenance strategies are crucial. In 1998, Chu and Beasley proposed an effective heuristic repair that is still relevant for recent metaheuristics. However, due to its deterministic nature, the diversity of solutions such heuristic provides is insufficient for long runs. As a result, the search for new solutions ceases after a while. This paper proposes an efficiency-based randomization strategy for the heuristic repair that increases the variability of the repaired solutions without deteriorating quality and improves the overall results.</p></details> |  |

The KP has several variants and, in this paper, we address the binary KP, where for a given knapsack (with limited capacity) as well as a number of items, each of them has its own weight (volume or cost) and value, the objective consists in finding a selection of items such that the total value of the selected items is maximized and the capacity limit of the knapsack is respected. In this paper, in memorial of Prof. Dr. Heiner M{\"u}ller-Merbach, a former president of IFORS, we address the binary KP and revisit a classical algorithm, named cascading-tree branch-and-bound algorithm, that was originally introduced by him in 1978. However, the algorithm is surprisingly absent from the scientific literature because the paper was published in a German journal. We carried out computational experiments in order to compare the algorithm versus some classic methods. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the interesting idea used in the cascading-tree algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Average sensitivity of the Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13343v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In resource allocation, we often require that the output allocation of an algorithm is stable against input perturbation because frequent reallocation is costly and untrustworthy. Varma and Yoshida (SODA'21) formalized this requirement for algorithms as the notion of average sensitivity. Here, the average sensitivity of an algorithm on an input instance is, roughly speaking, the average size of the symmetric difference of the output for the instance and that for the instance with one item deleted, where the average is taken over the deleted item. In this work, we consider the average sensitivity of the knapsack problem, a representative example of a resource allocation problem. We first show a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the knapsack problem with average sensitivity $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$. Then, we complement this result by showing that any $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm has average sensitivity $\Omega(\epsilon^{-1})$. As an application of our algorithm, we consider the incremental knapsack problem in the random-order setting, where the goal is to maintain a good solution while items arrive one by one in a random order. Specifically, we show that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with amortized recourse $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$ and amortized update time $O(\log n+f_\epsilon)$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $f_\epsilon>0$ is a value depending on $\epsilon$.</p></details> | 23 pages, ESA 2022 |

The problem recently attracted a lot of attention due to its applications in various domains of combination optimization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We improve the approximation factor of the fastest deterministic algorithm from $6+\epsilon$ to $5+\epsilon$ while keeping the best query complexity of $O(n)$, where $\epsilon >0$ is a constant parameter. Our technique is based on optimizing the performance of two components: the threshold greedy subroutine and the building of two disjoint sets as candidate solutions. Besides, by carefully analyzing the cost of candidate solutions, we obtain a tighter approximation factor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Bidding in Knapsack Auctions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07928v3)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines knapsack auctions as a method to solve the knapsack problem with incomplete information, where object values are private and sizes are public. We analyze three auction types-uniform price (UP), discriminatory price (DP), and generalized second price (GSP)-to determine efficient resource allocation in these settings. Using a Greedy algorithm for allocating objects, we analyze bidding behavior, revenue and efficiency of these three auctions using theory, lab experiments, and AI-enriched simulations. Our results suggest that the uniform-price auction has the highest level of truthful bidding and efficiency while the discriminatory price and the generalized second-price auctions are superior in terms of revenue generation. This study not only deepens the understanding of auction-based approaches to NP-hard problems but also provides practical insights for market design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Fairness in Online Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13293v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The online knapsack problem is a classic problem in the field of online algorithms. Its canonical version asks how to pack items of different values and weights arriving online into a capacity-limited knapsack so as to maximize the total value of the admitted items. Although optimal competitive algorithms are known for this problem, they may be fundamentally unfair, i.e., individual items may be treated inequitably in different ways. We formalize a practically-relevant notion of time fairness which effectively models a trade off between static and dynamic pricing in a motivating application such as cloud resource allocation, and show that existing algorithms perform poorly under this metric. We propose a parameterized deterministic algorithm where the parameter precisely captures the Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness (static pricing) and competitiveness (dynamic pricing). We show that randomization is theoretically powerful enough to be simultaneously competitive and fair; however, it does not work well in experiments. To further improve the trade-off between fairness and competitiveness, we develop a nearly-optimal learning-augmented algorithm which is fair, consistent, and robust (competitive), showing substantial performance improvements in numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024. 26 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms with Sliding Window Selection for the Dynamic Chance-Constrained Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08219v1)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms are particularly effective for optimisation problems with dynamic and stochastic components. We propose multi-objective evolutionary approaches for the knapsack problem with stochastic profits under static and dynamic weight constraints. The chance-constrained problem model allows us to effectively capture the stochastic profits and associate a confidence level to the solutions' profits. We consider a bi-objective formulation that maximises expected profit and minimises variance, which allows optimising the problem independent of a specific confidence level on the profit. We derive a three-objective formulation by relaxing the weight constraint into an additional objective. We consider the GSEMO algorithm with standard and a sliding window-based parent selection to evaluate the objective formulations. Moreover, we modify fitness formulations and algorithms for the dynamic problem variant to store some infeasible solutions to cater to future changes. We conduct experimental investigations on both problems using the proposed problem formulations and algorithms. Our results show that three-objective approaches outperform approaches that use bi-objective formulations, and they further improve when GSEMO uses sliding window selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using 3-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms for the Dynamic Chance Constrained Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06014v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world optimization problems often involve stochastic and dynamic components. Evolutionary algorithms are particularly effective in these scenarios, as they can easily adapt to uncertain and changing environments but often uncertainty and dynamic changes are studied in isolation. In this paper, we explore the use of 3-objective evolutionary algorithms for the chance constrained knapsack problem with dynamic constraints. In our setting, the weights of the items are stochastic and the knapsack's capacity changes over time. We introduce a 3-objective formulation that is able to deal with the stochastic and dynamic components at the same time and is independent of the confidence level required for the constraint. This new approach is then compared to the 2-objective formulation which is limited to a single confidence level. We evaluate the approach using two different multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), namely the global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO) and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), across various benchmark scenarios. Our analysis highlights the advantages of the 3-objective formulation over the 2-objective formulation in addressing the dynamic chance constrained knapsack problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[0-1 Knapsack in Nearly Quadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04093v2)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for the fundamental \emph{0-1 Knapsack} problem. Recent research interest has focused on its fine-grained complexity with respect to the number of items $n$ and the \emph{maximum item weight} $w_{\max}$. Under $(\min,+)$-convolution hypothesis, 0-1 Knapsack does not have $O((n+w_{\max})^{2-\delta})$ time algorithms (Cygan-Mucha-W\k{e}grzycki-W\l{}odarczyk 2017 and K\"{u}nnemann-Paturi-Schneider 2017). On the upper bound side, currently the fastest algorithm runs in $\tilde O(n + w_{\max}^{12/5})$ time (Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang 2023), improving the earlier $O(n + w_{\max}^3)$-time algorithm by Polak, Rohwedder, and W\k{e}grzycki (2021). In this paper, we close this gap between the upper bound and the conditional lower bound (up to subpolynomial factors): - The 0-1 Knapsack problem has a deterministic algorithm in $O(n + w_{\max}^{2}\log^4w_{\max})$ time. Our algorithm combines and extends several recent structural results and algorithmic techniques from the literature on knapsack-type problems: - We generalize the "fine-grained proximity" technique of Chen, Lian, Mao, and Zhang (2023) derived from the additive-combinatorial results of Bringmann and Wellnitz (2021) on dense subset sums. This allows us to bound the support size of the useful partial solutions in the dynamic program. - To exploit the small support size, our main technical component is a vast extension of the "witness propagation" method, originally designed by Deng, Mao, and Zhong (2023) for speeding up dynamic programming in the easier unbounded knapsack settings. To extend this approach to our 0-1 setting, we use a novel pruning method, as well as the two-level color-coding of Bringmann (2017) and the SMAWK algorithm on tall matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 co...</summary><p>v2 comment: To appear in STOC 2024. v1 comment: This paper supersedes an earlier manuscript arXiv:2307.09454 that contained weaker results.

| **[Convolution and Knapsack in Higher Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16117v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Knapsack problem, one is given the task of packing a knapsack of a given size with items in order to gain a packing with a high profit value. In recent years, a connection to the $(\max,+)$-convolution problem has been established, where knapsack solutions can be combined by building the convolution of two sequences. This observation has been used to give conditional lower bounds but also parameterized algorithms. In this paper we want to carry these results into higher dimension. We consider Knapsack where items are characterized by multiple properties - given through a vector - and a knapsack that has a capacity vector. The packing must now not exceed any of the given capacity constraints. In order to show a similar sub-quadratic lower bound we introduce a multi-dimensional version of convolution as well. Instead of combining sequences, we will generalize this problem and combine higher dimensional matrices. We will establish a few variants of these problems and prove that they are all equivalent in terms of algorithms that allow for a running time sub-quadratic in the number of entries of the matrix. We further develop a parameterized algorithm to solve higher dimensional Knapsack. The techniques we apply are inspired by an algorithm introduced by Axiotis and Tzamos. In general, we manage not only to extend their result to higher dimension. We will show that even for higher dimensional Knapsack, we can reduce the problem to convolution on one-dimensional sequences, leading to an $\mathcal{O}(d(n + D \cdot \max\{\Pi_{i=1}^d{t_i}, t_{\max}\log t_{\max}\} ))$ algorithm, where $D$ is the number of different weight vectors, $t$ the capacity vector and $d$ is the dimension of the problem. Finally we also modify this algorithm to handle items with negative weights to cross the bridge from solving not only Knapsack but also Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) in general.</p></details> |  |

We apply this framework to the hypergraph matching, knapsack, and $k$-column sparse packing problems. In the hypergraph matching setting, we adapt the technique of Guruganesh, Lee (2018) to non-constructively prove that the correlation gap is at least $\frac{1-e^{-k}}{k}$ and provide a monotone $\left(b,\frac{1-e^{-bk}}{bk}\right)$-balanced contention resolution scheme, generalizing the results of Bruggmann, Zenklusen (2019). For the knapsack problem, we prove that the correlation gap of instances where exactly $k$ copies of each item fit into the knapsack is at least $\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2}$ and provide several monotone contention resolution schemes: a $\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2}$-balanced scheme for instances where all item sizes are strictly bigger than $\frac{1}{2}$, a $\frac{4}{9}$-balanced scheme for instances where all item sizes are at most $\frac{1}{2}$, and a $0.279$-balanced scheme for instances with arbitrary item sizes. For $k$-column sparse packing integer programs, we slightly modify the $\left(2k+o\left(k\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-CS-PIP based on the strengthened LP relaxation presented in Brubach et al. (2019) to obtain a $\frac{1}{4k+o\left(k\right)}$-balanced contention resolution scheme and hence a $\left(4k+o\left(k\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-CS-PIP based on the natural LP relaxation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis defended at ETH Zurich.

In the $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation setting, although there is a fine-grained lower bound of $(n + 1 / \epsilon) ^ {2 - o(1)}$ based on the $(\min, +)$-convolution hypothesis ([K{\"u}nnemann, Paturi and Stefan Schneider, ICALP 2017] and [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki and Wlodarczyk, 2017]), the best algorithm is randomized and runs in $\tilde O\left(n + (\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{11/5}/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})}\right)$ time [Deng, Jin and Mao, SODA 2023], and it remains an important open problem whether an algorithm with a running time that matches the lower bound (up to a sub-polynomial factor) exists. We answer the question positively by showing a deterministic $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation scheme for knapsack that runs in $\tilde O(n + (1 / \epsilon) ^ {2})$ time. We first extend a known lemma in a recursive way to reduce the problem to $n \epsilon$-additive approximation for $n$ items with profits in $[1, 2)$. Then we give a simple efficient geometry-based algorithm for the reduced problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A constant time complexity algorithm for the unbounded knapsack problem with bounded coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11320v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark instances for the unbounded knapsack problem are typically generated according to specific criteria within a given constant range $R$, and these instances can be referred to as the unbounded knapsack problem with bounded coefficients (UKPB). In order to increase the difficulty of solving these instances, the knapsack capacity $C$ is usually set to a very large value. Therefore, an exact algorithm that neither time complexity nor space complexity includes the capacity coefficient $C$ is highly anticipated. In this paper, we propose an exact algorithm with time complexity of $O(R^4)$ and space complexity of $O(R^3)$. The algorithm initially divides the multiset $N$ into two multisubsets, $N_1$ and $N_2$, based on the profit density of their types. For the multisubset $N_2$ composed of types with profit density lower than the maximum profit density type, we utilize a recent branch and bound (B\&B) result by Dey et al. (Math. Prog., pp 569-587, 2023) to determine the maximum selection number for types in $N_2$. We then employ the Unbounded-DP algorithm to exactly solve for the types in $N_2$. For the multisubset $N_1$ composed of the maximum profit density type and its counterparts with the same profit density, we transform it into a linear Diophantine equation and leverage relevant conclusions from the Frobenius problem to solve it efficiently. In particular, the proof techniques required by the algorithm are primarily covered in the first-year mathematics curriculum, which is convenient for subsequent researchers to grasp.</p></details> |  |
| **[An upper bound of the mutation probability in the genetic algorithm for general 0-1 knapsack problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11307v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important part of genetic algorithms (GAs), mutation operators is widely used in evolutionary algorithms to solve $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems because it can increase the population diversity of individual. Due to limitations in mathematical tools, the mutation probability of the mutation operator is primarily empirically set in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel reduction method for the 0-1 knapsack problem(0-1 KP) and an improved mutation operator (IMO) based on the assumption $\mathcal{NP}\neq\mathcal{P}$, along with the utilization of linear relaxation techniques and a recent result by Dey et al. (Math. Prog., pp 569-587, 2022). We employ this method to calculate an upper bound of the mutation probability in general instances of the 0-1 KP, and construct an instance where the mutation probability does not tend towards 0 as the problem size increases. Finally, we prove that the probability of the IMO hitting the optimal solution within only a single iteration in large-scale instances is superior to that of the traditional mutation operator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amplitude-Ensemble Quantum-Inspired Tabu Search Algorithm for Solving 0/1 Knapsack Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12867v2)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, an improved version of QTS (Quantum-inspired Tabu Search) has been proposed, which enhances the utilization of population information, called "amplitude-ensemble" QTS (AE-QTS). This makes AE-QTS more similar to the real quantum search algorithm, Grover Search Algorithm, in abstract concept, while keeping the simplicity of the algorithm. Later, we demonstrate the AE-QTS on the classical combinatorial optimization 0/1 knapsack problem. Experimental results show that the AE-QTS outperforms other algorithms, including the QTS, by at least an average of 20% in all cases and even by 30% in some cases. Even as the problem complexity increases, the quality of the solutions found by our method remains superior to that of the QTS. These results prove that our method has better search performance.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Adversarial Knapsack and Secondary Effects of Common Information for Cyber Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10789v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variations of the Flip-It game have been applied to model network cyber operations. While Flip-It can accurately express uncertainty and loss of control, it imposes no essential resource constraints for operations. Capture the flag (CTF) style competitive games, such as Flip-It , entail uncertainties and loss of control, but also impose realistic constraints on resource use. As such, they bear a closer resemblance to actual cyber operations. We formalize a dynamical network control game for CTF competitions and detail the static game for each time step. The static game can be reformulated as instances of a novel optimization problem called Adversarial Knapsack (AK) or Dueling Knapsack (DK) when there are only two players. We define the Adversarial Knapsack optimization problems as a system of interacting Weighted Knapsack problems, and illustrate its applications to general scenarios involving multiple agents with conflicting optimization goals, e.g., cyber operations and CTF games in particular. Common awareness of the scenario, rewards, and costs will set the stage for a non-cooperative game. Critically, rational players may second guess that their AK solution -- with a better response and higher reward -- is possible if opponents predictably play their AK optimal solutions. Thus, secondary reasoning which such as belief modeling of opponents play can be anticipated for rational players and will introduce a type of non-stability where players maneuver for slight reward differentials. To analyze this, we provide the best-response algorithms and simulation software to consider how rational agents may heuristically search for maneuvers. We further summarize insights offered by the game model by predicting that metrics such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) may intensify the secondary reasoning in cyber operations.</p></details> | 26 pages |

We prove that this is almost optimal: We give a family of $n$-node graphs for which every polynomial-size MIP formulation requires $\Omega(n/\log^2 n)$ integer variables. By a polyhedral reduction we obtain an analogous result for $n$-item knapsack problems. In both cases, this improves the previously known bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ by Cevallos, Weltge & Zenklusen (SODA 2018). To this end, we show that there exists a family of $n$-node graphs whose stable set polytopes satisfy the following: any $(1+\varepsilon/n)$-approximate extended formulation for these polytopes, for some constant $\varepsilon > 0$, has size $2^{\Omega(n/\log n)}$. Our proof extends and simplifies the information-theoretic methods due to G\"o\"os, Jain & Watson (FOCS 2016, SIAM J. Comput. 2018) who showed the same result for the case of exact extended formulations (i.e. $\varepsilon = 0$).</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full paper of IPCO 2024 version</p></details> |

We introduce a continuous relaxation for the CKP, represented as a non-convex optimization problem, which we call the non-convex relaxation. A comparative study shows that the non-convex relaxation provides an upper bound for the CKP, at least as tight as those obtained from other continuous relaxations for the CKP. Furthermore, the quality of the obtained upper bound is guaranteed to be at most twice the optimal objective value of the CKP. Despite its non-convex nature, we show that the non-convex relaxation can be solved in polynomial time. Subsequently, we proposed a polynomial-time 1/2-approximation algorithm for the CKP based on this relaxation, providing a lower bound for the CKP. Computational test results demonstrate that the non-convex relaxation and the proposed approximation algorithm yields tight lower and upper bounds for the CKP within a short computation time, ensuring the quality of the obtained bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating the Geometric Knapsack Problem in Near-Linear Time and Dynamically](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00536v1)** | 2024-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important goal in algorithm design is determining the best running time for solving a problem (approximately). For some problems, we know the optimal running time, assuming certain conditional lower bounds. In this work, we study the $d$-dimensional geometric knapsack problem where we are far from this level of understanding. We are given a set of weighted d-dimensional geometric items like squares, rectangles, or hypercubes and a knapsack which is a square or a (hyper-)cube. We want to select a subset of items that fit non-overlappingly inside the knapsack, maximizing the total profit of the packed items. We make a significant step towards determining the best running time for solving these problems approximately by presenting approximation algorithms with near-linear running times for any constant dimension d and any constant parameter $\epsilon$. For (hyper)-cubes, we present a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm whose running time drastically improves upon the known $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm which has a running time where the exponent of n depends exponentially on $1/\epsilon$ and $d$. Moreover, we present a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for rectangles in the setting without rotations and a $(17/9+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm if we allow rotations by 90 degrees. The best known polynomial time algorithms for these settings have approximation ratios of $17/9+\epsilon$ and $1.5+\epsilon$, respectively, and running times in which the exponent of n depends exponentially on $1/\epsilon$. We also give dynamic algorithms with polylogarithmic query and update times and the same approximation guarantees as the algorithms above. Key to our results is a new family of structured packings which we call easily guessable packings. They are flexible enough to guarantee profitable solutions and structured enough so that we can compute these solutions quickly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Removable Online Knapsack and Advice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01867v2)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the knapsack problem, we are given a knapsack of some capacity and a set of items, each with a size and a value. The goal is to pack a selection of these items fitting the knapsack that maximizes the total value. The online version of this problem reveals the items one by one. For each item, the algorithm must decide immediately whether to pack it or not. We consider a natural variant of this problem, coined removable online knapsack. It differs from the classical variant by allowing the removal of packed items. Repacking is impossible, however: Once an item is removed, it is gone for good. We analyze the advice complexity of this problem. It measures how many advice bits an omniscient oracle needs to provide for an online algorithm to reach any given competitive ratio, which is, understood in its strict sense, just the approximation factor. We show that the competitive ratio jumps from unbounded without advice to near-optimal with just constantly many advice bits, a behavior unique among all problems examined so far. We also examine algorithms with barely any advice, for example just a single bit, and analyze the special case of the proportional knapsack problem, where an item's size always equals its value. We show that advice algorithms have various concrete applications and that lower bounds on the advice complexity of any problem are exceptionally strong. Our results improve some of the best known lower bounds on the competitive ratio for randomized algorithms and even for deterministic deterministic algorithms in established models such as knapsack with a resource buffer and various problems with multiple knapsacks. The seminal paper introducing knapsack with removability proposed such a problem for which we can even establish a one-to-one correspondence with the advice model; this paper therefore also provides a comprehensive analysis for this neglected problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knapsack with Small Items in Near-Quadratic Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03075v3)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Knapsack problem is one of the most fundamental NP-complete problems at the intersection of computer science, optimization, and operations research. A recent line of research worked towards understanding the complexity of pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for Knapsack parameterized by the maximum item weight $w_{\mathrm{max}}$ and the number of items $n$. A conditional lower bound rules out that Knapsack can be solved in time $O((n+w_{\mathrm{max}})^{2-\delta})$ for any $\delta > 0$ [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki, Wlodarczyk'17, K\"unnemann, Paturi, Schneider'17]. This raised the question whether Knapsack can be solved in time $\tilde O((n+w_{\mathrm{max}})^2)$. This was open both for 0-1-Knapsack (where each item can be picked at most once) and Bounded Knapsack (where each item comes with a multiplicity). The quest of resolving this question lead to algorithms that solve Bounded Knapsack in time $\tilde O(n^3 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ [Tamir'09], $\tilde O(n^2 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ and $\tilde O(n w_{\mathrm{max}}^3)$ [Bateni, Hajiaghayi, Seddighin, Stein'18], $O(n^2 w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ and $\tilde O(n w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ [Eisenbrand and Weismantel'18], $O(n + w_{\mathrm{max}}^3)$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki'21], and very recently $\tilde O(n + w_{\mathrm{max}}^{12/5})$ [Chen, Lian, Mao, Zhang'23]. In this paper we resolve this question by designing an algorithm for Bounded Knapsack with running time $\tilde O(n + w_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$, which is conditionally near-optimal. This resolves the question both for the classic 0-1-Knapsack problem and for the Bounded Knapsack problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, accepted at STOC'24</p></details> |

The model features a single seller who has a fixed quantity of a perfectly divisible item. Impatient buyers with a piece-wise linear utility function arrive randomly and they report the two-dimensional private information: marginal value and demanded quantity. We derive a revenue-maximizing dynamic mechanism in a finite discrete time framework that satisfies incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and feasibility conditions. It is achieved by characterizing buyers' utility and deriving the Bellman equation. Moreover, we propose the essential penalty scheme for incentive compatibility, as well as the allocation and payment policies. Lastly, we propose algorithms to approximate the optimal policy, based on the Monte Carlo simulation-based regression method and reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figures, presented in AAAI 38th conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Our main contributions are combinatorial algorithms for the offline CCKP and an online version of the CCKP. For the offline problem, we present a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and show that it can be cast as the maximization of a submodular function with cardinality constraints; the latter property allows us to derive a greedy $(1 - \frac{1}{e})$-approximation algorithm. For the online CCKP in the random order model, we derive a $\frac{10.427}{\alpha}$-competitive algorithm based on $\alpha$-approximation algorithms for the offline CCKP; moreover, we derive stronger guarantees for the cases wherein the cardinality capacity is very small or relatively large. Finally, we investigate the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms in numerical experiments.</p></details> | 34 pages, 3 figures |

That is, we assume that there exists a graph structure on the set of items of knapsack and the solution also needs to satisfy certain graph theoretic properties on top of knapsack constraints. In particular, we need to compute in the connected knapsack problem a connected subset of items which has maximum value subject to the size of knapsack constraint. We show that this problem is strongly NP-complete even for graphs of maximum degree four and NP-complete even for star graphs. On the other hand, we develop an algorithm running in time $O\left(2^{tw\log tw}\cdot\text{poly}(\min\{s^2,d^2\})\right)$ where $tw,s,d$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, size, and target value of the knapsack. We further exhibit a $(1-\epsilon)$ factor approximation algorithm running in time $O\left(2^{tw\log tw}\cdot\text{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\right)$ for every $\epsilon>0$. We show similar results for several other graph theoretic properties, namely path and shortest-path under the problem names path-knapsack and shortestpath-knapsack. Our results seems to indicate that connected-knapsack is computationally hardest followed by path-knapsack and shortestpath-knapsack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in LATIN 2024</p></details> |
| **[Securing Neural Networks with Knapsack Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10442v2)** | 2023-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLaaS Service Providers (SPs) holding a Neural Network would like to keep the Neural Network weights secret. On the other hand, users wish to utilize the SPs' Neural Network for inference without revealing their data. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) offers a solution to achieve this. Computations in MPC involve communication, as the parties send data back and forth. Non-linear operations are usually the main bottleneck requiring the bulk of communication bandwidth. In this paper, we focus on ResNets, which serve as the backbone for many Computer Vision tasks, and we aim to reduce their non-linear components, specifically, the number of ReLUs. Our key insight is that spatially close pixels exhibit correlated ReLU responses. Building on this insight, we replace the per-pixel ReLU operation with a ReLU operation per patch. We term this approach 'Block-ReLU'. Since different layers in a Neural Network correspond to different feature hierarchies, it makes sense to allow patch-size flexibility for the various layers of the Neural Network. We devise an algorithm to choose the optimal set of patch sizes through a novel reduction of the problem to the Knapsack Problem. We demonstrate our approach in the semi-honest secure 3-party setting for four problems: Classifying ImageNet using ResNet50 backbone, classifying CIFAR100 using ResNet18 backbone, Semantic Segmentation of ADE20K using MobileNetV2 backbone, and Semantic Segmentation of Pascal VOC 2012 using ResNet50 backbone. Our approach achieves competitive performance compared to a handful of competitors. Our source code is publicly available: https://github.com/yg320/secure_inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chance-Constrained Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem: Model, Algorithms, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14690v2)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Motivated by several significant real-world applications, this work investigates a novel variant of MCKP called chance-constrained multiple-choice knapsack problem (CCMCKP), where the item weights are random variables. In particular, we focus on the practical scenario of CCMCKP, where the probability distributions of random weights are unknown but only sample data is available. We first present the problem formulation of CCMCKP and then establish two benchmark sets. The first set contains synthetic instances and the second set is devised to simulate a real-world application scenario of a certain telecommunication company. To solve CCMCKP, we propose a data-driven adaptive local search (DDALS) algorithm. The main novelty of DDALS lies in its data-driven solution evaluation approach that can effectively handle unknown probability distributions of item weights. Moreover, in cases with unknown distributions, high intensity of chance constraints, limited amount of sample data and large-scale problems, it still exhibits good performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DDALS over other baselines on the two benchmarks. Additionally, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component of the algorithm. Finally, DDALS can serve as the baseline for future research, and the benchmark sets are open-sourced to further promote research on this challenging problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Bilevel Knapsack Problem using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13436v3)** | 2023-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bilevel Optimization Problem is a hierarchical optimization problem with two agents, a leader and a follower. The leader make their own decisions first, and the followers make the best choices accordingly. The leader knows the information of the followers, and the goal of the problem is to find the optimal solution by considering the reactions of the followers from the leader's point of view. For the Bilevel Optimization Problem, there are no general and efficient algorithms or commercial solvers to get an optimal solution, and it is very difficult to get a good solution even for a simple problem. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach using Graph Neural Networks to solve the bilevel knapsack problem. We train the model to predict the leader's solution and use it to transform the hierarchical optimization problem into a single-level optimization problem to get the solution. Our model found the feasible solution that was about 500 times faster than the exact algorithm with $1.7\%$ optimal gap. Also, our model performed well on problems of different size from the size it was trained on.</p></details> | 27 pages, 2 figures |

Solving these problems may be computationally expensive. Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of deep learning methods to approximate the solutions to such problems. A core problem is how to enforce or encourage constraint satisfaction in predicted solutions. A promising approach for predicting solutions to constrained optimisation problems is the Lagrangian Dual Framework which builds on the method of Lagrangian Relaxation. In this paper we develop neural network models to approximate Knapsack Problem solutions using the Lagrangian Dual Framework while improving constraint satisfaction. We explore the problems of output interpretation and model selection within this context. Experimental results show strong constraint satisfaction with a minor reduction of optimality as compared to a baseline neural network which does not explicitly model the constraints.</p></details> |  |

Recent years have seen a growing interest in settling their fine-grained complexity with respect to various parameters. For Bounded Knapsack, the number of items $n$ and the maximum item weight $w_{\max}$ are two of the most natural parameters that have been studied extensively in the literature. The previous best running time in terms of $n$ and $w_{\max}$ is $O(n + w^3_{\max})$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki '21]. There is a conditional lower bound of $O((n + w_{\max})^{2-o(1)})$ based on $(\min,+)$-convolution hypothesis [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki, Wlodarczyk '17]. We narrow the gap significantly by proposing a $\tilde{O}(n + w^{12/5}_{\max})$-time algorithm. Note that in the regime where $w_{\max} \approx n$, our algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{12/5})$ time, while all the previous algorithms require $\Omega(n^3)$ time in the worst case. For Bounded Subset Sum, we give two algorithms running in $\tilde{O}(nw_{\max})$ and $\tilde{O}(n + w^{3/2}_{\max})$ time, respectively. These results match the currently best running time for 0-1 Subset Sum. Prior to our work, the best running times (in terms of $n$ and $w_{\max}$) for Bounded Subset Sum is $\tilde{O}(n + w^{5/3}_{\max})$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki '21] and $\tilde{O}(n + \mu_{\max}^{1/2}w_{\max}^{3/2})$ [implied by Bringmann '19 and Bringmann, Wellnitz '21], where $\mu_{\max}$ refers to the maximum multiplicity of item weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SODA2024</p></details> |
| **[High-dimensional Linear Bandits with Knapsacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01327v1)** | 2023-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the contextual bandits with knapsack (CBwK) problem under the high-dimensional setting where the dimension of the feature is large. The reward of pulling each arm equals the multiplication of a sparse high-dimensional weight vector and the feature of the current arrival, with additional random noise. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit this sparsity structure to achieve improved regret for the CBwK problem. To this end, we first develop an online variant of the hard thresholding algorithm that performs the sparse estimation in an online manner. We further combine our online estimator with a primal-dual framework, where we assign a dual variable to each knapsack constraint and utilize an online learning algorithm to update the dual variable, thereby controlling the consumption of the knapsack capacity. We show that this integrated approach allows us to achieve a sublinear regret that depends logarithmically on the feature dimension, thus improving the polynomial dependency established in the previous literature. We also apply our framework to the high-dimension contextual bandit problem without the knapsack constraint and achieve optimal regret in both the data-poor regime and the data-rich regime. We finally conduct numerical experiments to show the efficient empirical performance of our algorithms under the high dimensional setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing The Knapsack Challenge Through Cultural Algorithm Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03324v1)** | 2023-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "0-1 knapsack problem" stands as a classical combinatorial optimization conundrum, necessitating the selection of a subset of items from a given set. Each item possesses inherent values and weights, and the primary objective is to formulate a selection strategy that maximizes the total value while adhering to a predefined capacity constraint. In this research paper, we introduce a novel variant of Cultural Algorithms tailored specifically for solving 0-1 knapsack problems, a well-known combinatorial optimization challenge. Our proposed algorithm incorporates a belief space to refine the population and introduces two vital functions for dynamically adjusting the crossover and mutation rates during the evolutionary process. Through extensive experimentation, we provide compelling evidence of the algorithm's remarkable efficiency in consistently locating the global optimum, even in knapsack problems characterized by high dimensions and intricate constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Total-Cost Constraints in Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks, with Application to Fairness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15807v2)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider contextual bandit problems with knapsacks [CBwK], a problem where at each round, a scalar reward is obtained and vector-valued costs are suffered. The learner aims to maximize the cumulative rewards while ensuring that the cumulative costs are lower than some predetermined cost constraints. We assume that contexts come from a continuous set, that costs can be signed, and that the expected reward and cost functions, while unknown, may be uniformly estimated -- a typical assumption in the literature. In this setting, total cost constraints had so far to be at least of order $T^{3/4}$, where $T$ is the number of rounds, and were even typically assumed to depend linearly on $T$. We are however motivated to use CBwK to impose a fairness constraint of equalized average costs between groups: the budget associated with the corresponding cost constraints should be as close as possible to the natural deviations, of order $\sqrt{T}$. To that end, we introduce a dual strategy based on projected-gradient-descent updates, that is able to deal with total-cost constraints of the order of $\sqrt{T}$ up to poly-logarithmic terms. This strategy is more direct and simpler than existing strategies in the literature. It relies on a careful, adaptive, tuning of the step size.</p></details> |  |

The massive instances occurring in modern day applications can render existing algorithms prohibitively slow, while frequently, those instances are also inherently stochastic. Focusing on these challenges, we revisit the classic problem of maximizing a (possibly non-monotone) submodular function subject to a knapsack constraint. We present a simple randomized greedy algorithm that achieves a $5.83$ approximation and runs in $O(n \log n)$ time, i.e., at least a factor $n$ faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms. The robustness of our approach allows us to further transfer it to a stochastic version of the problem. There, we obtain a 9-approximation to the best adaptive policy, which is the first constant approximation for non-monotone objectives. Experimental evaluation of our algorithms showcases their improved performance on real and synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Same ...</summary><p>Same as v1.

For the latter, an important measure is the adaptive complexity, which captures the number of sequential rounds of parallel computation needed by an algorithm to terminate. In this work we obtain the first constant factor approximation algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization subject to a knapsack constraint with near-optimal $O(\log n)$ adaptive complexity. Low adaptivity by itself, however, is not enough: a crucial feature to account for is represented by the total number of function evaluations (or value queries). Our algorithm asks $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ value queries, but can be modified to run with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ instead, while retaining a low adaptive complexity of $O(\log^2n)$. Besides the above improvement in adaptivity, this is also the first combinatorial approach with sublinear adaptive complexity for the problem and yields algorithms comparable to the state-of-the-art even for the special cases of cardinality constraints or monotone objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version addresses a gap in the probabilistic analysis of the approximation guarantees in the previous version of this work.

Recently, In-Context Learning demonstrated significant performance advances for reasoning tasks. In this paradigm, a large language model performs predictions based on a small set of supporting exemplars. The performance of In-Context Learning depends heavily on the selection procedure of the supporting exemplars, particularly in the case of HybridQA, where considering the diversity of reasoning chains and the large size of the hybrid contexts becomes crucial. In this work, we present Selection of ExEmplars for hybrid Reasoning (SEER), a novel method for selecting a set of exemplars that is both representative and diverse. The key novelty of SEER is that it formulates exemplar selection as a Knapsack Integer Linear Program. The Knapsack framework provides the flexibility to incorporate diversity constraints that prioritize exemplars with desirable attributes, and capacity constraints that ensure that the prompt size respects the provided capacity budgets. The effectiveness of SEER is demonstrated on FinQA and TAT-QA, two real-world benchmarks for HybridQA, where it outperforms previous exemplar selection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready revision for EMNLP 2023 main conference.

| **[No Polynomial Kernels for Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12593v2)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on kernelization algorithms for the fundamental Knapsack problem. A kernelization algorithm (or kernel) is a polynomial-time reduction from a problem onto itself, where the output size is bounded by a function of some problem-specific parameter. Such algorithms provide a theoretical model for data reduction and preprocessing and are central in the area of parameterized complexity. In this way, a kernel for Knapsack for some parameter $k$ reduces any instance of Knapsack to an equivalent instance of size at most $f(k)$ in polynomial time, for some computable function $f(\cdot)$. When $f(k)=k^{O(1)}$ then we call such a reduction a polynomial kernel. Our study focuses on two natural parameters for Knapsack: The number of different item weights $w_{\#}$, and the number of different item profits $p_{\#}$. Our main technical contribution is a proof showing that Knapsack does not admit a polynomial kernel for any of these two parameters under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions. Our proof discovers an elaborate application of the standard kernelization lower bound framework, and develops along the way novel ideas that should be useful for other problems as well. We complement our lower bounds by showing the Knapsack admits a polynomial kernel for the combined parameter $w_{\#}+p_{\#}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tight Guarantees for Multi-unit Prophet Inequalities and Online Stochastic Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02058v4)** | 2023-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prophet inequalities are a useful tool for designing online allocation procedures and comparing their performance to the optimal offline allocation. In the basic setting of $k$-unit prophet inequalities, the well-known procedure of Alaei (2011) with its celebrated performance guarantee of $1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+3}}$ has found widespread adoption in mechanism design and general online allocation problems in online advertising, healthcare scheduling, and revenue management. Despite being commonly used to derive approximately-optimal algorithms for multi-resource allocation problems, the tightness of Alaei's guarantee has remained unknown. In this paper characterize the tight guarantee in Alaei's setting, which we show is in fact strictly greater than $1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+3}}$ for all $k>1$. We also consider the more general online stochastic knapsack problem where each individual allocation can consume an arbitrary fraction of the initial capacity. Here we introduce a new ``best-fit'' procedure with a performance guarantee of $\frac{1}{3+e^{-2}}\approx0.319$, which we also show is tight with respect to the standard LP relaxation. This improves the previously best-known guarantee of 0.2 for online knapsack. Our analysis differs from existing ones by eschewing the need to split items into ``large'' or ``small'' based on capacity consumption, using instead an invariant for the overall utilization on different sample paths. Finally, we refine our technique for the unit-density special case of knapsack, and improve the guarantee from 0.321 to 0.3557 in the multi-resource appointment scheduling application of Stein et al. (2020).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the full version of the SODA 2022 paper</p></details> |
| **[Size-stochastic Knapsack Online Contention Resolution Schemes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08622v2)** | 2023-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online contention resolution schemes (OCRSs) are effective rounding techniques for online stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. These schemes randomly and sequentially round a fractional solution to a relaxed problem that can be formulated in advance. In this study, we propose OCRSs for online stochastic generalized assignment problems. In the problem of our OCRSs, sequentially arriving items are packed into a single knapsack, and their sizes are revealed only after insertion. The goal of the problem is to maximize the acceptance probability, which is the smallest probability among the items being placed in the knapsack. Since the item sizes are unknown beforehand, a capacity overflow may occur. We consider two distinct settings: the hard constraint, where items that cause overflow are rejected, and the soft constraint setting, where such items are accepted. Under the hard constraint setting, we present an algorithm with an acceptance probability of $1/3$ and prove that no algorithm can achieve an acceptance probability greater than $3/7$. Under the soft constraint setting, we propose an algorithm with an acceptance probability of $1/2$ and demonstrate that this is best possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Complexity of Recognizing Facets for the Knapsack Polytope](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03311v2)** | 2023-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexity class DP is the class of all languages that are the intersection of a language in NP and a language in co-NP, as coined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (1982). Hartvigsen and Zemel (1992) conjectured that recognizing a facet for the knapsack polytope is DP-complete. While it has been known that the recognition problems of facets for polytopes associated with other well-known combinatorial optimization problems, e.g., traveling salesman, node/set packing/covering, are DP-complete, this conjecture on recognizing facets for the knapsack polytope remains open. We provide a positive answer to this conjecture. Moreover, despite the DP-hardness of the recognition problem, we give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if an inequality with a fixed number of distinct positive coefficients defines a facet of a knapsack polytope, generalizing a result of Balas (1975).</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Approximation Algorithms for Non-monotone $k$-Submodular Maximization under a Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12025v1)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of non-monotone $k$-submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint ($\kSMK$) over the ground set size $n$ has been raised in many applications in machine learning, such as data summarization, information propagation, etc. However, existing algorithms for the problem are facing questioning of how to overcome the non-monotone case and how to fast return a good solution in case of the big size of data. This paper introduces two deterministic approximation algorithms for the problem that competitively improve the query complexity of existing algorithms. Our first algorithm, $\LAA$, returns an approximation ratio of $1/19$ within $O(nk)$ query complexity. The second one, $\RLA$, improves the approximation ratio to $1/5-\epsilon$ in $O(nk)$ queries, where $\epsilon$ is an input parameter. Our algorithms are the first ones that provide constant approximation ratios within only $O(nk)$ query complexity for the non-monotone objective. They, therefore, need fewer the number of queries than state-of-the-the-art ones by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. Besides the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed ones with several experiments in some instances: Influence Maximization and Sensor Placement for the problem. The results confirm that our algorithms ensure theoretical quality as the cutting-edge techniques and significantly reduce the number of queries.</p></details> | 12 pages |

| **[Simple and Faster Algorithms for Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11307v1)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we obtain a number of new simple pseudo-polynomial time algorithms on the well-known knapsack problem, focusing on the running time dependency on the number of items $n$, the maximum item weight $w_\mathrm{max}$, and the maximum item profit $p_\mathrm{max}$. Our results include: - An $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}\cdot \min\{w_\mathrm{max},p_\mathrm{max}\})$-time randomized algorithm for 0-1 knapsack, improving the previous $\widetilde{O}(\min\{n w_\mathrm{max} p_\mathrm{max}^{2/3},n p_\mathrm{max} w_\mathrm{max}^{2/3}\})$ [Bringmann and Cassis, ESA'23] for the small $n$ case. - An $\widetilde{O}(n+\min\{w_\mathrm{max},p_\mathrm{max}\}^{5/2})$-time randomized algorithm for bounded knapsack, improving the previous $O(n+\min\{w_\mathrm{max}^3,p_\mathrm{max}^3\})$ [Polak, Rohwedder and Wegrzyck, ICALP'21].</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Knapsack with Small Items via L0-Proximity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09454v2)** | 2023-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for the fundamental \emph{0-1 Knapsack} problem. In terms of $n$ and $w_{\max}$, previous algorithms for 0-1 Knapsack have cubic time complexities: $O(n^2w_{\max})$ (Bellman 1957), $O(nw_{\max}^2)$ (Kellerer and Pferschy 2004), and $O(n + w_{\max}^3)$ (Polak, Rohwedder, and W\k{e}grzycki 2021). On the other hand, fine-grained complexity only rules out $O((n+w_{\max})^{2-\delta})$ running time, and it is an important question in this area whether $\tilde O(n+w_{\max}^2)$ time is achievable. Our main result makes significant progress towards solving this question: - The 0-1 Knapsack problem has a deterministic algorithm in $\tilde O(n + w_{\max}^{2.5})$ time. Our techniques also apply to the easier \emph{Subset Sum} problem: - The Subset Sum problem has a randomized algorithm in $\tilde O(n + w_{\max}^{1.5})$ time. This improves (and simplifies) the previous $\tilde O(n + w_{\max}^{5/3})$-time algorithm by Polak, Rohwedder, and W\k{e}grzycki (2021) (based on Galil and Margalit (1991), and Bringmann and Wellnitz (2021)). Similar to recent works on Knapsack (and integer programs in general), our algorithms also utilize the \emph{proximity} between optimal integral solutions and fractional solutions. Our new ideas are as follows: - Previous works used an $O(w_{\max})$ proximity bound in the $\ell_1$-norm. As our main conceptual contribution, we use an additive-combinatorial theorem by Erd\H{o}s and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy (1990) to derive an $\ell_0$-proximity bound of $\tilde O(\sqrt{w_{\max}})$. - Then, the main technical component of our Knapsack result is a dynamic programming algorithm that exploits both $\ell_0$- and $\ell_1$-proximity. It is based on a vast extension of the ``witness propagation'' method, originally designed by Deng, Mao, and Zhong (2023) for the easier \emph{unbounded} setting only.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is superseded by an updated version arXiv:2308.04093.

| **[A parameterized approximation scheme for the 2D-Knapsack problem with wide items](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10672v1)** | 2023-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a natural geometric variant of the classic Knapsack problem called 2D-Knapsack: we are given a set of axis-parallel rectangles and a rectangular bounding box, and the goal is to pack as many of these rectangles inside the box without overlap. Naturally, this problem is NP-complete. Recently, Grandoni et al. [ESA'19] showed that it is also W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size $k$ of the sought packing, and they presented a parameterized approximation scheme (PAS) for the variant where we are allowed to rotate the rectangles by 90{\textdegree} before packing them into the box. Obtaining a PAS for the original 2D-Knapsack problem, without rotation, appears to be a challenging open question. In this work, we make progress towards this goal by showing a PAS under the following assumptions: - both the box and all the input rectangles have integral, polynomially bounded sidelengths; - every input rectangle is wide -- its width is greater than its height; and - the aspect ratio of the box is bounded by a constant.Our approximation scheme relies on a mix of various parameterized and approximation techniques, including color coding, rounding, and searching for a structured near-optimum packing using dynamic programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Deterministic Approximation for Submodular Multiple Knapsack Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11450v5)** | 2023-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Submodular maximization has been a central topic in theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization over the last decades. Plenty of well-performed approximation algorithms have been designed for the problem over a variety of constraints. In this paper, we consider the submodular multiple knapsack problem (SMKP). In SMKP, the profits of each subset of elements are specified by a monotone submodular function. The goal is to find a feasible packing of elements over multiple bins (knapsacks) to maximize the profit. Recently, Fairstein et al.~[ESA20] proposed a nearly optimal $(1-e^{-1}-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for SMKP. Their algorithm is obtained by combining configuration LP, a grouping technique for bin packing, and the continuous greedy algorithm for submodular maximization. As a result, the algorithm is somewhat sophisticated and inherently randomized. In this paper, we present an arguably simple deterministic combinatorial algorithm for SMKP, which achieves a $(1-e^{-1}-\epsilon)$-approximation ratio. Our algorithm is based on very different ideas compared with Fairstein et al.~[ESA20].</p></details> | Accepted by ESA 2023 |
| **[Linear Query Approximation Algorithms for Non-monotone Submodular Maximization under Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10292v2)** | 2023-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work, for the first time, introduces two constant factor approximation algorithms with linear query complexity for non-monotone submodular maximization over a ground set of size $n$ subject to a knapsack constraint, $\mathsf{DLA}$ and $\mathsf{RLA}$. $\mathsf{DLA}$ is a deterministic algorithm that provides an approximation factor of $6+\epsilon$ while $\mathsf{RLA}$ is a randomized algorithm with an approximation factor of $4+\epsilon$. Both run in $O(n \log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)$ query complexity. The key idea to obtain a constant approximation ratio with linear query lies in: (1) dividing the ground set into two appropriate subsets to find the near-optimal solution over these subsets with linear queries, and (2) combining a threshold greedy with properties of two disjoint sets or a random selection process to improve solution quality. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed solutions with three applications: Revenue Maximization, Image Summarization, and Maximum Weighted Cut, showing that our algorithms not only return comparative results to state-of-the-art algorithms but also require significantly fewer queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximately Stationary Bandits with Knapsacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14686v2)** | 2023-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK), the generalization of the Bandits problem under global budget constraints, has received a lot of attention in recent years. Previous work has focused on one of the two extremes: Stochastic BwK where the rewards and consumptions of the resources of each round are sampled from an i.i.d. distribution, and Adversarial BwK where these parameters are picked by an adversary. Achievable guarantees in the two cases exhibit a massive gap: No-regret learning is achievable in the stochastic case, but in the adversarial case only competitive ratio style guarantees are achievable, where the competitive ratio depends either on the budget or on both the time and the number of resources. What makes this gap so vast is that in Adversarial BwK the guarantees get worse in the typical case when the budget is more binding. While ``best-of-both-worlds'' type algorithms are known (single algorithms that provide the best achievable guarantee in each extreme case), their bounds degrade to the adversarial case as soon as the environment is not fully stochastic. Our work aims to bridge this gap, offering guarantees for a workload that is not exactly stochastic but is also not worst-case. We define a condition, Approximately Stationary BwK, that parameterizes how close to stochastic or adversarial an instance is. Based on these parameters, we explore what is the best competitive ratio attainable in BwK. We explore two algorithms that are oblivious to the values of the parameters but guarantee competitive ratios that smoothly transition between the best possible guarantees in the two extreme cases, depending on the values of the parameters. Our guarantees offer great improvement over the adversarial guarantee, especially when the available budget is small. We also prove bounds on the achievable guarantee, showing that our results are approximately tight when the budget is small.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Approximation for Two-dimensional Vector Multiple Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02137v1)** | 2023-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the uniform $2$-dimensional vector multiple knapsack (2VMK) problem, a natural variant of multiple knapsack arising in real-world applications such as virtual machine placement. The input for 2VMK is a set of items, each associated with a $2$-dimensional weight vector and a positive profit, along with $m$ $2$-dimensional bins of uniform (unit) capacity in each dimension. The goal is to find an assignment of a subset of the items to the bins, such that the total weight of items assigned to a single bin is at most one in each dimension, and the total profit is maximized. Our main result is a $(1- \frac{\ln 2}{2} - \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for 2VMK, for every fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, thus improving the best known ratio of $(1 - \frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon)$ which follows as a special case from a result of [Fleischer at al., MOR 2011]. Our algorithm relies on an adaptation of the Round$\&$Approx framework of [Bansal et al., SICOMP 2010], originally designed for set covering problems, to maximization problems. The algorithm uses randomized rounding of a configuration-LP solution to assign items to $\approx m\cdot \ln 2 \approx 0.693\cdot m$ of the bins, followed by a reduction to the ($1$-dimensional) Multiple Knapsack problem for assigning items to the remaining bins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bandits with Replenishable Knapsacks: the Best of both Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08470v1)** | 2023-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bandits with knapsack (BwK) framework models online decision-making problems in which an agent makes a sequence of decisions subject to resource consumption constraints. The traditional model assumes that each action consumes a non-negative amount of resources and the process ends when the initial budgets are fully depleted. We study a natural generalization of the BwK framework which allows non-monotonic resource utilization, i.e., resources can be replenished by a positive amount. We propose a best-of-both-worlds primal-dual template that can handle any online learning problem with replenishment for which a suitable primal regret minimizer exists. In particular, we provide the first positive results for the case of adversarial inputs by showing that our framework guarantees a constant competitive ratio $\alpha$ when $B=\Omega(T)$ or when the possible per-round replenishment is a positive constant. Moreover, under a stochastic input model, our algorithm yields an instance-independent $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ regret bound which complements existing instance-dependent bounds for the same setting. Finally, we provide applications of our framework to some economic problems of practical relevance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fractionally Subadditive Maximization under an Incremental Knapsack Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14454v2)** | 2023-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of maximizing a fractionally subadditive function under a knapsack constraint that grows over time. An incremental solution to this problem is given by an order in which to include the elements of the ground set, and the competitive ratio of an incremental solution is defined by the worst ratio over all capacities relative to an optimum solution of the corresponding capacity. We present an algorithm that finds an incremental solution of competitive ratio at most $\max\{3.293\sqrt{M},2M\}$, under the assumption that the values of singleton sets are in the range $[1,M]$, and we give a lower bound of $\max\{2.618,M\}$ on the attainable competitive ratio. In addition, we establish that our framework captures potential-based flows between two vertices, and we give a lower bound of $\max\{2,M\}$ and an upper bound of $2M$ for the incremental maximization of classical flows with capacities in $[1,M]$ which is tight for the unit capacity case.</p></details> |  |

| **[Large W limit of the knapsack problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14080v2)** | 2023-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate the knapsack problem (KP) as a statistical physics system and compute the corresponding partition function as an integral in the complex plane. The introduced formalism allows us to derive three statistical-physics-based algorithms for the KP: one based on the recursive definition of the exact partition function; another based on the large weight limit of that partition function; and a final one based on the zero-temperature limit of the second. Comparing the performances of the algorithms, we find that they do not consistently outperform (in terms of runtime and accuracy) dynamic programming, annealing, or standard greedy algorithms. However, the exact partition function is shown to reproduce the dynamic programming solution to the KP, and the zero-temperature algorithm is shown to produce a greedy solution. Therefore, although dynamic programming and greedy solutions to the KP are conceptually distinct, the statistical physics formalism introduced in this work reveals that the large weight-constraint limit of the former leads to the latter. We conclude by discussing how to extend this formalism in order to obtain more accurate versions of the introduced algorithms and to other similar combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> | 36 pages, 19 figures |

| **[Faster Global Minimum Cut with Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05004v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global minimum cut is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem with wide-ranging applications. Often in practice, these problems are solved repeatedly on families of similar or related instances. However, the de facto algorithmic approach is to solve each instance of the problem from scratch discarding information from prior instances. In this paper, we consider how predictions informed by prior instances can be used to warm-start practical minimum cut algorithms. The paper considers the widely used Karger's algorithm and its counterpart, the Karger-Stein algorithm. Given good predictions, we show these algorithms become near-linear time and have robust performance to erroneous predictions. Both of these algorithms are randomized edge-contraction algorithms. Our natural idea is to probabilistically prioritize the contraction of edges that are unlikely to be in the minimum cut.</p></details> |  |

We give a new integer programming formulation for the problem, by adding knapsack cover constraints to the $p(p+q)$-connected capacitated edge-connectivity formulation studied in previous work, and show that the corresponding linear relaxation can be solved in polynomial time by giving an efficient separation oracle. Further, we show that independent randomized rounding yields an $O(\log n)$-approximation for arbitrary values of $p$ and $q$, improving the state-of-the-art $O(q\log n)$. For both separation and rounding, a key insight is to use Karger's bound on the number of near-minimum cuts.</p></details> | 11 pages |

In an $n$-node graph the best known $(1+o(1))$-approximate algorithm takes $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$ update time [Thorup 2007]. If the minimum cut is guaranteed to be $(\log n)^{o(1)}$, a deterministic exact algorithm with $n^{o(1)}$ update time exists [Jin, Sun, Thorup 2024]. We present the first fully dynamic algorithm for $(1+o(1))$-approximate minimum cut with $n^{o(1)}$ update time.

| **[Space Complexity of Minimum Cut Problems in Single-Pass Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01143v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of finding a minimum cut of a weighted graph presented as a single-pass stream. While graph sparsification in streams has been intensively studied, the specific application of finding minimum cuts in streams is less well-studied. To this end, we show upper and lower bounds on minimum cut problems in insertion-only streams for a variety of settings, including for both randomized and deterministic algorithms, for both arbitrary and random order streams, and for both approximate and exact algorithms. One of our main results is an $\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ space algorithm with fast update time for approximating a spectral cut query with high probability on a stream given in an arbitrary order. Our result breaks the $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$ space lower bound required of a sparsifier that approximates all cuts simultaneously. Using this result, we provide streaming algorithms with near optimal space of $\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ for minimum cut and approximate all-pairs effective resistances, with matching space lower-bounds. The amortized update time of our algorithms is $\widetilde{O}(1)$, provided that the number of edges in the input graph is at least $(n/\varepsilon^2)^{1+o(1)}$. We also give a generic way of incorporating sketching into a recursive contraction algorithm to improve the post-processing time of our algorithms. In addition to these results, we give a random-order streaming algorithm that computes the {\it exact} minimum cut on a simple, unweighted graph using $\widetilde{O}(n)$ space. Finally, we give an $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$ space lower bound for deterministic minimum cut algorithms which matches the best-known upper bound up to polylogarithmic factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>25+3 ...</summary><p>25+3 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Tree-Packing Revisited: Faster Fully Dynamic Min-Cut and Arboricity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09141v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A tree-packing is a collection of spanning trees of a graph. It has been a useful tool for computing the minimum cut in static, dynamic, and distributed settings. In particular, [Thorup, Comb. 2007] used them to obtain his dynamic min-cut algorithm with $\tilde O(\lambda^{14.5}\sqrt{n})$ worst-case update time. We reexamine this relationship, showing that we need to maintain fewer spanning trees for such a result; we show that we only need to pack $\Theta(\lambda^3 \log m)$ greedy trees to guarantee a 1-respecting cut or a trivial cut in some contracted graph. Based on this structural result, we then provide a deterministic algorithm for fully dynamic exact min-cut, that has $\tilde O(\lambda^{5.5}\sqrt{n})$ worst-case update time, for min-cut value bounded by $\lambda$. In particular, this also leads to an algorithm for general fully dynamic exact min-cut with $\tilde O(m^{1-1/12})$ amortized update time, improving upon $\tilde O(m^{1-1/31})$ [Goranci et al., SODA 2023]. We also give the first fully dynamic algorithm that maintains a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the fractional arboricity -- which is strictly harder than the integral arboricity. Our algorithm is deterministic and has $O(\alpha \log^6m/\varepsilon^4)$ amortized update time, for arboricity at most $\alpha$. We extend these results to a Monte Carlo algorithm with $O(\text{poly}(\log m,\varepsilon^{-1}))$ amortized update time against an adaptive adversary. Our algorithms work on multi-graphs as well. Both result are obtained by exploring the connection between the min-cut/arboricity and (greedy) tree-packing. We investigate tree-packing in a broader sense; including a lower bound for greedy tree-packing, which - to the best of our knowledge - is the first progress on this topic since [Thorup, Comb. 2007].</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SODA '25</p></details> |
| **[Approximating the Held-Karp Bound for Metric TSP in Nearly Linear Work and Polylogarithmic Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14745v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a nearly linear work parallel algorithm for approximating the Held-Karp bound for the Metric TSP problem. Given an edge-weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ on $m$ edges and $\epsilon>0$, it returns a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the Held-Karp bound with high probability, in $\tilde{O}(m/\epsilon^4)$ work and $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ depth. While a nearly linear time sequential algorithm was known for almost a decade (Chekuri and Quanrud'17), it was not known how to simultaneously achieve nearly linear work alongside polylogarithmic depth. Using a reduction by Chalermsook et al.'22, we also give a parallel algorithm for computing a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate fractional solution to the $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph (kECSS) problem, with the same complexity. To obtain these results, we introduce a notion of core-sequences for the parallel Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) framework (Luby-Nisan'93, Young'01). For the Metric TSP and kECSS problems, core-sequences enable us to exploit the structure of approximate minimum cuts to reduce the cost per iteration and/or the number of iterations. The acceleration technique via core-sequences is generic and of independent interest. In particular, it improves the best-known iteration complexity of MWU algorithms for packing/covering LPs from $poly(\log nnz(A))$ to polylogarithmic in the product of cardinalities of the core-sequence sets where $A$ is the constraint matrix of the LP. For certain implicitly defined LPs such as the kECSS LP, this yields an exponential improvement in depth.</p></details> |  |

As an application of our results, we obtain for every fixed $k$ a linear-time algorithm for computing the $k$-edge-connected components of a given graph, solving a long-standing open problem. More generally, we obtain a $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithm for computing a $k$-Gomory-Hu tree of a given graph, which is a structure representing pairwise minimum cuts of size $<k$. Our main technical result, from which the other results follow, is a $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithm for computing a $k$-lean tree decomposition of a given graph. This is a tree decomposition with adhesion size $<k$ that captures the existence of separators of size $<k$ between subsets of its bags. A $k$-lean tree decomposition is also an unbreakable tree decomposition with optimal unbreakability parameters for the adhesion size bound $k$. As further applications, we obtain $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithms for $k$-vertex connectivity and for element connectivity $k$-Gomory-Hu tree. All of our algorithms are deterministic. Our techniques are inspired by the tenth paper of the Graph Minors series of Robertson and Seymour and by Bodlaender's parameterized linear-time algorithm for treewidth.</p></details> | 107 pages |
| **[A Simpler Approach for Monotone Parametric Minimum Cut: Finding the Breakpoints in Order](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15920v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present parametric breadth-first search (PBFS), a new algorithm for solving the parametric minimum cut problem in a network with source-sink-monotone capacities. The objective is to find the set of breakpoints, i.e., the points at which the minimum cut changes. It is well known that this problem can be solved in the same asymptotic runtime as the static minimum cut problem. However, existing algorithms that achieve this runtime bound involve fairly complicated steps that are inefficient in practice. PBFS uses a simpler approach that discovers the breakpoints in ascending order, which allows it to achieve the desired runtime bound while still performing well in practice. We evaluate our algorithm on benchmark instances from polygon aggregation and computer vision. Polygon aggregation was recently proposed as an application for parametric minimum cut, but the monotonicity property has not been exploited fully. PBFS outperforms the state of the art on most benchmark instances, usually by a factor of 2-3. It is particularly strong on instances with many breakpoints, which is the case for polygon aggregation. Compared to the existing min-cut-based approach for polygon aggregation, PBFS scales much better with the instance size. On large instances with millions of vertices, it is able to compute all breakpoints in a matter of seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Cuts with Arbitrary Size Constraints Through Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04732v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common way of partitioning graphs is through minimum cuts. One drawback of classical minimum cut methods is that they tend to produce small groups, which is why more balanced variants such as normalized and ratio cuts have seen more success. However, we believe that with these variants, the balance constraints can be too restrictive for some applications like for clustering of imbalanced datasets, while not being restrictive enough for when searching for perfectly balanced partitions. Here, we propose a new graph cut algorithm for partitioning graphs under arbitrary size constraints. We formulate the graph cut problem as a Gromov-Wasserstein with a concave regularizer problem. We then propose to solve it using an accelerated proximal GD algorithm which guarantees global convergence to a critical point, results in sparse solutions and only incurs an additional ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ compared to the classical spectral clustering algorithm but was seen to be more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Sensitivity Oracle for Steiner Mincut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17715v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected weighted graph on $n=|V|$ vertices and $S\subseteq V$ be a Steiner set. Steiner mincut is a well-studied concept, which provides a generalization to both (s,t)-mincut (when $|S|=2$) and global mincut (when $|S|=n$). Here, we address the problem of designing a compact data structure that can efficiently report a Steiner mincut and its capacity after the failure of any edge in $G$; such a data structure is known as a \textit{Sensitivity Oracle} for Steiner mincut. In the area of minimum cuts, although many Sensitivity Oracles have been designed in unweighted graphs, however, in weighted graphs, Sensitivity Oracles exist only for (s,t)-mincut [Annals of Operations Research 1991, NETWORKS 2019, ICALP 2024], which is just a special case of Steiner mincut. Here, we generalize this result to any arbitrary set $S\subseteq V$. 1. Sensitivity Oracle: Assuming the capacity of every edge is known, a. there is an ${\mathcal O}(n)$ space data structure that can report the capacity of Steiner mincut in ${\mathcal O}(1)$ time and b. there is an ${\mathcal O}(n(n-|S|+1))$ space data structure that can report a Steiner mincut in ${\mathcal O}(n)$ time after the failure of any edge in $G$. 2. Lower Bound: We show that any data structure that, after the failure of any edge, can report a Steiner mincut or its capacity must occupy $\Omega(n^2)$ bits of space in the worst case, irrespective of the size of the Steiner set. The lower bound in (2) shows that the assumption in (1) is essential to break the $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on space. For $|S|=n-k$ for any constant $k\ge 0$, it occupies only ${\mathcal O}(n)$ space. So, we also present the first Sensitivity Oracle occupying ${\mathcal O}(n)$ space for global mincut.</p></details> |  |

It is a hypergraph preserving the minimum multicut values of any set of pairs over $T$ where the value is at most $c$. This is a new variant of the multicut-mimicking network of a graph in [Wahlstr\"om ICALP'20], which introduces a parameter $c$ and extends it to handle hypergraphs. Additionally, it is a natural extension of the \emph{connectivity-$c$ mimicking network} introduced by [Chalermsook et al. SODA'21] and [Jiang et al.

| **[Finding Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07290v3)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many studies have been devoted to finding diverse solutions in classical combinatorial problems, such as Vertex Cover (Baste et al., IJCAI'20), Matching (Fomin et al., ISAAC'20) and Spanning Tree (Hanaka et al., AAAI'21). We initiate the algorithmic study of $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts which, given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, two specified vertices $s,t \in V$, and an integer $k > 0$, asks for a collection of $k$ minimum $s$-$t$ cuts in $G$ that has maximum diversity. We investigate the complexity of the problem for maximizing three diversity measures that can be applied to a collection of cuts: (i) the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances, (ii) the cardinality of the union of cuts in the collection, and (iii) the minimum pairwise Hamming distance. We prove that $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts can be solved in strongly polynomial time for diversity measures (i) and (ii) via submodular function minimization. We obtain this result by establishing a connection between ordered collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts and the theory of distributive lattices. When restricted to finding only collections of mutually disjoint solutions, we provide a more practical algorithm that finds a maximum set of pairwise disjoint minimum $s$-$t$ cuts. For graphs with small minimum $s$-$t$ cut, it runs in the time of a single max-flow computation. Our results stand in contrast to the problem of finding $k$ diverse global minimum cuts -- which is known to be NP-hard even for the disjoint case (Hanaka et al., AAAI'23) -- and partially answer a long-standing open question of Wagner (Networks, 1990) about improving the complexity of finding disjoint collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts. Lastly, we show that $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts subject to diversity measure (iii) is NP-hard already for $k=3$.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ea...</summary><p>An earlier version of this work appeared at the 34th International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2023).

| **[The Parameterized Complexity Landscape of Two-Sets Cut-Uncut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13543v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Two-Sets Cut-Uncut, we are given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and two terminal sets $S$ and $T$. The task is to find a minimum cut $C$ in $G$ (if there is any) separating $S$ from $T$ under the following ``uncut'' condition. In the graph $(V,E \setminus C)$, the terminals in each terminal set remain in the same connected component. In spite of the superficial similarity to the classic problem Minimum $s$-$t$-Cut, Two-Sets Cut-Uncut is computationally challenging. In particular, even deciding whether such a cut of any size exists, is already NP-complete. We initiate a systematic study of Two-Sets Cut-Uncut within the context of parameterized complexity. By leveraging known relations between many well-studied graph parameters, we characterize the structural properties of input graphs that allow for polynomial kernels, fixed-parameter tractability (FPT), and slicewise polynomial algorithms (XP). Our main contribution is the near-complete establishment of the complexity of these algorithmic properties within the described hierarchy of graph parameters. On a technical level, our main results are fixed-parameter tractability for the (vertex-deletion) distance to cographs and an OR-cross composition excluding polynomial kernels for the vertex cover number of the input graph (under the standard complexity assumption NP is not contained in coNP/poly).</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional limits of graph cuts on discretized grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15297v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph cuts are among the most prominent tools for clustering and classification analysis. While intensively studied from geometric and algorithmic perspectives, graph cut-based statistical inference still remains elusive to a certain extent. Distributional limits are fundamental in understanding and designing such statistical procedures on randomly sampled data. We provide explicit limiting distributions for balanced graph cuts in general on a fixed but arbitrary discretization. In particular, we show that Minimum Cut, Ratio Cut and Normalized Cut behave asymptotically as the minimum of Gaussians as sample size increases. Interestingly, our results reveal a dichotomy for Cheeger Cut: The limiting distribution of the optimal objective value is the minimum of Gaussians only when the optimal partition yields two sets of unequal volumes, while otherwise the limiting distribution is the minimum of a random mixture of Gaussians. Further, we show the bootstrap consistency for all types of graph cuts by utilizing the directional differentiability of cut functionals. We validate these theoretical findings by Monte Carlo experiments, and examine differences between the cuts and the dependency on the underlying distribution. Additionally, we expand our theoretical findings to the Xist algorithm, a computational surrogate of graph cuts recently proposed in Suchan, Li and Munk (arXiv, 2023), thus demonstrating the practical applicability of our findings e.g. in statistical tests.</p></details> | 59 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Interdiction of minimum spanning trees and other matroid bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14906v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the minimum spanning tree (MST) interdiction problem, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge weights, and want to find some $X\subseteq E$ satisfying a knapsack constraint such that the MST weight in $(V,E\setminus X)$ is maximized. Since MSTs of $G$ are the minimum weight bases in the graphic matroid of $G$, this problem is a special case of matroid interdiction on a matroid $M=(E,\mathcal{I})$, in which the objective is instead to maximize the minimum weight of a basis of $M$ which is disjoint from $X$. By reduction from 0-1 knapsack, matroid interdiction is NP-complete, even for uniform matroids. We develop a new exact algorithm to solve the matroid interdiction problem. One of the key components of our algorithm is a dynamic programming upper bound which only requires that a simpler discrete derivative problem can be calculated/approximated for the given matroid. Our exact algorithm then uses this bound within a custom branch-and-bound algorithm. For different matroids, we show how this discrete derivative can be calculated/approximated. In particular, for partition matroids, this yields a pseudopolynomial time algorithm. For graphic matroids, an approximation can be obtained by solving a sequence of minimum cut problems, which we apply to the MST interdiction problem. The running time of our algorithm is asymptotically faster than the best known MST interdiction algorithm, up to polylog factors. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art computational performance: we solved all available instances from the literature, and in many cases reduced the best running time from hours to seconds.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Tight Lower Bounds for Directed Cut Sparsification and Distributed Min-Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13231v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider two fundamental cut approximation problems on large graphs. We prove new lower bounds for both problems that are optimal up to logarithmic factors. The first problem is to approximate cuts in balanced directed graphs. In this problem, the goal is to build a data structure that $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-approximates cut values in graphs with $n$ vertices. For arbitrary directed graphs, such a data structure requires $\Omega(n^2)$ bits even for constant $\epsilon$. To circumvent this, recent works study $\beta$-balanced graphs, meaning that for every directed cut, the total weight of edges in one direction is at most $\beta$ times that in the other direction. We consider two models: the {\em for-each} model, where the goal is to approximate each cut with constant probability, and the {\em for-all} model, where all cuts must be preserved simultaneously. We improve the previous $\Omega(n \sqrt{\beta/\epsilon})$ lower bound to $\tilde{\Omega}(n \sqrt{\beta}/\epsilon)$ in the for-each model, and we improve the previous $\Omega(n \beta/\epsilon)$ lower bound to $\Omega(n \beta/\epsilon^2)$ in the for-all model. This resolves the main open questions of (Cen et al., ICALP, 2021). The second problem is to approximate the global minimum cut in a local query model, where we can only access the graph via degree, edge, and adjacency queries. We improve the previous $\Omega\bigl(\frac{m}{k}\bigr)$ query complexity lower bound to $\Omega\bigl(\min\{m, \frac{m}{\epsilon^2 k}\}\bigr)$ for this problem, where $m$ is the number of edges, $k$ is the size of the minimum cut, and we seek a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation. In addition, we show that existing upper bounds with slight modifications match our lower bound up to logarithmic factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Broadcast in Highly Connected Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12930v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the classic broadcast problem, wherein we have $k$ messages, each composed of $O(\log{n})$ bits, distributed arbitrarily across a network. The objective is to broadcast these messages to all nodes in the network. In the distributed CONGEST model, a textbook algorithm solves this problem in $O(D+k)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph. While the $O(D)$ term in the round complexity is unavoidable$\unicode{x2014}$given that $\Omega(D)$ rounds are necessary to solve broadcast in any graph$\unicode{x2014}$it remains unclear whether the $O(k)$ term is needed in all graphs. In cases where the minimum cut size is one, simply transmitting messages from one side of the cut to the other would require $\Omega(k)$ rounds. However, if the size of the minimum cut is larger, it may be possible to develop faster algorithms. This motivates the exploration of the broadcast problem in networks with high edge connectivity. In this work, we present a simple randomized distributed algorithm for performing $k$-message broadcast in $O(((n+k)/\lambda)\log n)$ rounds in any $n$-node simple graph with edge connectivity $\lambda$. When $k = \Omega(n)$, our algorithm is universally optimal, up to an $O(\log n)$ factor, as its complexity nearly matches an information-theoretic $\Omega(k/\lambda)$ lower bound that applies to all graphs, even when the network topology is known to the algorithm. The setting $k = \Omega(n)$ is particularly interesting because several fundamental problems can be reduced to broadcasting $\Omega(n)$ messages. Our broadcast algorithm finds several applications in distributed computing, enabling $O(1)$-approximation for all distances and $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for all cut sizes in $\tilde{O}(n/\lambda)$ rounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering A Workload-balanced Push-Relabel Algorithm for Massive Graphs on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00270v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The push-relabel algorithm is an efficient algorithm that solves the maximum flow/ minimum cut problems of its affinity to parallelization. As the size of graphs grows exponentially, researchers have used Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the computation of the push-relabel algorithm further. However, prior works need to handle the significant memory consumption to represent a massive residual graph. In addition, the nature of their algorithms has inherently imbalanced workload distribution on GPUs. This paper first identifies the two challenges with the memory and computational models. Based on the analysis of these models, we propose a workload-balanced push-relabel algorithm (WBPR) with two enhanced compressed sparse representations (CSR) and a vertex-centric approach. The enhanced CSR significantly reduces memory consumption, while the vertex-centric approach alleviates the workload imbalance and improves the utilization of the GPU. In the experiment, our approach reduces the memory consumption from O(V^2) to O(V + E). Moreover, we can achieve up to 7.31x and 2.29x runtime speedup compared to the state-of-the-art on real-world graphs in maximum flow and bipartite matching tasks, respectively. Our code will be open-sourced for further research on accelerating the push-relabel algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Finding such a cut is a classic problem that is dual to that of finding a maximum flow from $s$ to $t$. In this work we describe a quantum algorithm for the minimum $s{\operatorname{-}}t$ cut problem on undirected graphs. For an undirected graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and integral edge weights bounded by $W$, the algorithm computes with high probability the weight of a minimum $s{\operatorname{-}}t$ cut after $\widetilde O(\sqrt{m} n^{5/6} W^{1/3})$ queries to the adjacency list of $G$. For simple graphs this bound is always $\widetilde O(n^{11/6})$, even in the dense case when $m = \Omega(n^2)$. In contrast, a randomized algorithm must make $\Omega(m)$ queries to the adjacency list of a simple graph $G$ even to decide whether $s$ and $t$ are connected.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The proof of the upper bound on the time complexity in the first arXiv version contained a fatal flaw.

| **[Detachment Problem -- Application in Prevention of Information Leakage in Stock Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07074v1)** | 2024-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Detachment Problem. It can be seen as a generalized Vaccination Problem. The aim is to optimally cut the individuals' ties to circles that connect them to others, to minimize the overall information transfer in a social network. When an individual is isolated from a particular circle, it leads to the elimination of the connections to all the members of that circle, yet the connections to other circles remain. This approach contrasts with the conventional vaccination problem, in which a subset of vertices is totally eliminated. In our case, the connections of individuals to their circles are selectively, rather than entirely, eliminated. Contextually, this article focuses on private information flows, specifically within networks formed by memberships in circles of insiders in companies. Our quasi-empirical study uses simulated information flows on an observable network, and the statistical properties of the simulated information flows are matched with real-world data. In a broader context, this paper presents the Detachment Problem as a versatile approach for optimal social distancing, applicable across various scenarios. We propose and define a concept of expected proportional outside influence, or EPOI, as measure of how widespread information leak is. We also implement a greedy algorithm for finding a set of detachments to minimize EPOI. For comparison, we devise a simple heuristic based on minimal cut, to separate the most influential circles from each other. We provide evidence that the greedy algorithm is not optimal, and it is sometimes outperformed by the simple heuristic minimum cut algorithm, However, the greedy algorithm outperforms the cut algorithm in most cases. Further avenues of research are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Near-Linear Time Minimum Cut in Weighted Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05627v1)** | 2024-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 1996, Karger [Kar96] gave a startling randomized algorithm that finds a minimum-cut in a (weighted) graph in time $O(m\log^3n)$ which he termed near-linear time meaning linear (in the size of the input) times a polylogarthmic factor. In this paper, we give the first deterministic algorithm which runs in near-linear time for weighted graphs. Previously, the breakthrough results of Kawarabayashi and Thorup [KT19] gave a near-linear time algorithm for simple graphs. The main technique here is a clustering procedure that perfectly preserves minimum cuts. Recently, Li [Li21] gave an $m^{1+o(1)}$ deterministic minimum-cut algorithm for weighted graphs; this form of running time has been termed "almost-linear''. Li uses almost-linear time deterministic expander decompositions which do not perfectly preserve minimum cuts, but he can use these clusterings to, in a sense, "derandomize'' the methods of Karger. In terms of techniques, we provide a structural theorem that says there exists a sparse clustering that preserves minimum cuts in a weighted graph with $o(1)$ error. In addition, we construct it deterministically in near linear time. This was done exactly for simple graphs in [KT19, HRW20] and with polylogarithmic error for weighted graphs in [Li21]. Extending the techniques in [KT19, HRW20] to weighted graphs presents significant challenges, and moreover, the algorithm can only polylogarithmically approximately preserve minimum cuts. A remaining challenge is to reduce the polylogarithmic-approximate clusterings to $1+o(1/\log n)$-approximate so that they can be applied recursively as in [Li21] over $O(\log n)$ many levels. This is an additional challenge that requires building on properties of tree-packings in the presence of a wide range of edge weights to, for example, find sources for local flow computations which identify minimum cuts that cross clusters.</p></details> | SODA 2024, 60 pages |

DoubleCoverUDF takes a learned UDF and a user-specified parameter $r$ (a small positive real number) as input and extracts an iso-surface with an iso-value $r$ using the conventional marching cubes algorithm. We show that the computed iso-surface is the boundary of the $r$-offset volume of the target zero level-set $S$, which is an orientable manifold, regardless of the topology of $S$. Next, the algorithm computes a covering map to project the boundary mesh onto $S$, preserving the mesh's topology and avoiding folding. If $S$ is an orientable manifold surface, our algorithm separates the double-layered mesh into a single layer using a robust minimum-cut post-processing step. Otherwise, it keeps the double-layered mesh as the output. We validate our algorithm by reconstructing 3D surfaces of open models and demonstrate its efficacy and effectiveness on synthetic models and benchmark datasets. Our experimental results confirm that our method is robust and produces meshes with better quality in terms of both visual evaluation and quantitative measures than existing UDF-based methods.

| **[Minimum 0-Extension Problems on Directed Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00153v2)** | 2024-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a metric $\mu$ on a finite set $T$, the minimum 0-extension problem 0-Ext$[\mu]$ is defined as follows: Given $V\supseteq T$ and $\ c:{V \choose 2}\rightarrow \mathbf{Q_+}$, minimize $\sum c(xy)\mu(\gamma(x),\gamma(y))$ subject to $\gamma:V\rightarrow T,\ \gamma(t)=t\ (\forall t\in T)$, where the sum is taken over all unordered pairs in $V$. This problem generalizes several classical combinatorial optimization problems such as the minimum cut problem or the multiterminal cut problem. Karzanov and Hirai established a complete classification of metrics $\mu$ for which 0-Ext$[\mu]$ is polynomial time solvable or NP-hard. This result can also be viewed as a sharpening of the general dichotomy theorem for finite-valued CSPs (Thapper and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} 2016) specialized to 0-Ext$[\mu]$. In this paper, we consider a directed version $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$ of the minimum 0-extension problem, where $\mu$ and $c$ are not assumed to be symmetric. We extend the NP-hardness condition of 0-Ext$[\mu]$ to $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$: If $\mu$ cannot be represented as the shortest path metric of an orientable modular graph with an orbit-invariant ``directed'' edge-length, then $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$ is NP-hard. We also show a partial converse: If $\mu$ is a directed metric of a modular lattice with an orbit-invariant directed edge-length, then $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$ is tractable.

Colin de Verdi\`{e}re [Algorithmica, 2017] showed that Multicut with $t$ terminals on a graph $G$ of genus $g$ can be solved in time $f(t,g)n^{O(\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$. Cohen-Addad et al. [JACM, 2021] proved a matching lower bound showing that the exponent of $n$ is essentially best possible (for fixed values of $t$ and $g$), even in the special case of Multiway Cut, where the demand graph $H$ is a complete graph. However, this lower bound tells us nothing about other special cases of Multicut such as Group 3-Terminal Cut. We show that if the demand pattern is, in some sense, close to being a complete bipartite graph, then Multicut can be solved faster than $f(t,g)n^{O(\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$, and furthermore this is the only property that allows such an improvement. Formally, for a class $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$ is the special case where the demand graph $H$ is in $\mathcal{H}$. For every fixed class $\mathcal{H}$ (satisfying some mild closure property), fixed $g$, and fixed $t$, our main result gives tight upper and lower bounds on the exponent of $n$ in algorithms solving Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$. In addition, we investigate a similar setting where, instead of parameterizing by the genus $g$ of $G$, we parameterize by the minimum number $k$ of edges of $G$ that need to be deleted to obtain a planar graph. Interestingly, in this setting it makes a significant difference whether the graph $G$ is weighted or unweighted: further nontrivial algorithmic techniques give substantial improvements in the unweighted case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentially Private Algorithms for Graphs Under Continual Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14756v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private algorithms protect individuals in data analysis scenarios by ensuring that there is only a weak correlation between the existence of the user in the data and the result of the analysis. Dynamic graph algorithms maintain the solution to a problem (e.g., a matching) on an evolving input, i.e., a graph where nodes or edges are inserted or deleted over time. They output the value of the solution after each update operation, i.e., continuously. We study (event-level and user-level) differentially private algorithms for graph problems under continual observation, i.e., differentially private dynamic graph algorithms. We present event-level private algorithms for partially dynamic counting-based problems such as triangle count that improve the additive error by a polynomial factor (in the length $T$ of the update sequence) on the state of the art, resulting in the first algorithms with additive error polylogarithmic in $T$. We also give $\varepsilon$-differentially private and partially dynamic algorithms for minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, densest subgraph, and maximum matching. The additive error of our improved MST algorithm is $O(W \log^{3/2}T / \varepsilon)$, where $W$ is the maximum weight of any edge, which, as we show, is tight up to a $(\sqrt{\log T} / \varepsilon)$-factor. For the other problems, we present a partially-dynamic algorithm with multiplicative error $(1+\beta)$ for any constant $\beta > 0$ and additive error $O(W \log(nW) \log(T) / (\varepsilon \beta))$. Finally, we show that the additive error for a broad class of dynamic graph algorithms with user-level privacy must be linear in the value of the output solution's range.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected typos in lower bounds in Table 1.

| **[Cactus Representations in Polylogarithmic Max-flow via Maximal Isolating Mincuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10706v1)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A cactus representation of a graph, introduced by Dinitz et al. in 1976, is an edge sparsifier of $O(n)$ size that exactly captures all global minimum cuts of the graph. It is a central combinatorial object that has been a key ingredient in almost all algorithms for the connectivity augmentation problems and for maintaining minimum cuts under edge insertions (e.g. [NGM97], [CKL+22], [Hen97]). This sparsifier was generalized to Steiner cactus for a vertex set $T$, which can be seen as a vertex sparsifier of $O(|T|)$ size that captures all partitions of $T$ corresponding to a $T$-Steiner minimum cut, and also hypercactus, an analogous concept in hypergraphs. These generalizations further extend the applications of cactus to the Steiner and hypergraph settings. In a long line of work on fast constructions of cactus and its generalizations, a near-linear time construction of cactus was shown by [Karger and Panigrahi 2009]. Unfortunately, their technique based on tree packing inherently does not generalize. The state-of-the-art algorithms for Steiner cactus and hypercactus are still slower than linear time by a factor of $\Omega(|T|)$ [DV94] and $\Omega(n)$ [CX17], respectively. We show how to construct both Steiner cactus and hypercactus using polylogarithmic calls to max flow, which gives the first almost-linear time algorithms of both problems. The constructions immediately imply almost-linear-time connectivity augmentation algorithms in the Steiner and hypergraph settings, as well as speed up the incremental algorithm for maintaining minimum cuts in hypergraphs by a factor of $n$. The key technique behind our result is a novel variant of the influential isolating mincut technique [LP20, AKL+21] which we called maximal isolating mincuts. This technique makes the isolating mincuts to be "more balanced" which, we believe, will likely be useful in future applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SODA 2024</p></details> |

Locality means that the decision we make about each edge only depends on its constant radius neighborhood. We show two applications of the algorithms: one is related to the Aldous-Lyons Conjecture, and the other is about approximating the neighborhood distribution of graphs by bounded-size graphs. The scope of our results can be extended to unimodular random graphs and networks. As a corollary, we generalize the Maximum Flow Minimum Cut Theorem to unimodular random flow networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding coherent node groups in directed graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02993v1)** | 2023-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Summarizing a large graph by grouping the nodes into clusters is a standard technique for studying the given network. Traditionally, the order of the discovered groups does not matter. However, there are applications where, for example, given a directed graph, we would like to find coherent groups while minimizing the backward cross edges. More formally, in this paper, we study a problem where we are given a directed network and are asked to partition the graph into a sequence of coherent groups while attempting to conform to the cross edges. We assume that nodes in the network have features, and we measure the group coherence by comparing these features. Furthermore, we incorporate the cross edges by penalizing the forward cross edges and backward cross edges with different weights. If the weights are set to 0, then the problem is equivalent to clustering. However, if we penalize the backward edges significantly more, then the order of discovered groups matters, and we can view our problem as a generalization of a classic segmentation problem. To solve the algorithm we consider a common iterative approach where we solve the groups given the centroids, and then find the centroids given the groups. We show that - unlike in clustering - the first subproblem is NP-hard. However, we show that if the underlying graph is a tree we can solve the subproblem with dynamic programming. In addition, if the number of groups is 2, we can solve the subproblem with a minimum cut. For the more general case, we propose a heuristic where we optimize each pair of groups separately while keeping the remaining groups intact. We also propose a greedy search where nodes are moved between the groups while optimizing the overall loss. We demonstrate with our experiments that the algorithms are practical and yield interpretable results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Approximations for Relative Survivable Network Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06656v2)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most important and well-studied settings for network design is edge-connectivity requirements. This encompasses uniform demands such as the Minimum $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem as well as nonuniform demands such as the Survivable Network Design problem (SND). In a recent paper by [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] , the authors observed that a weakness of these formulations is that it does not enable one to consider fault-tolerance in graphs that have just a few small cuts. To remedy this, they introduced new variants of these problems under the notion "relative" fault-tolerance. Informally, this requires not that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults (as in the classical setting), but that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults and the two nodes are connected in the underlying graph post-faults. The problem is already highly non-trivial even for the case of a single demand. Due to difficulties introduced by this new notion of fault-tolerance, the results in [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] are quite limited. For the Relative Survivable Network Design problem (RSND), when the demands are not uniform they give a nontrivial result only when there is a single demand with a connectivity requirement of $3$: a non-optimal $27/4$-approximation. We strengthen this result in two significant ways: We give a $2$-approximation for RSND where all requirements are at most $3$, and a $2^{O(k^2)}$-approximation for RSND with a single demand of arbitrary value $k$. To achieve these results, we first use the "cactus representation'' of minimum cuts to give a lossless reduction to normal SND. Second, we extend the techniques of [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] to prove a generalized and more complex version of their structure theorem, which we then use to design a recursive approximation algorithm.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Fault Trees, Decision Trees, And Binary Decision Diagrams: A Systematic Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04448v1)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reliability engineering, we need to understand system dependencies, cause-effect relations, identify critical components, and analyze how they trigger failures. Three prominent graph models commonly used for these purposes are fault trees (FTs), decision trees (DTs), and binary decision diagrams (BDDs). These models are popular because they are easy to interpret, serve as a communication tool between stakeholders of various backgrounds, and support decision-making processes. Moreover, these models help to understand real-world problems by computing reliability metrics, minimum cut sets, logic rules, and displaying dependencies. Nevertheless, it is unclear how these graph models compare. Thus, the goal of this paper is to understand the similarities and differences through a systematic comparison based on their (i) purpose and application, (ii) structural representation, (iii) analysis methods, (iv) construction, and (v) benefits & limitations. Furthermore, we use a running example based on a Container Seal Design to showcase the models in practice. Our results show that, given that FTs, DTs and BDDs have different purposes and application domains, they adopt different structural representations and analysis methodologies that entail a variety of benefits and limitations, the latter can be addressed via conversion methods or extensions. Specific remarks are that BDDs can be considered as a compact representation of binary DTs, since the former allows sub-node sharing, which makes BDDs more efficient at representing logical rules than binary DTs. It is possible to obtain cut sets from BDDs and DTs and construct a FT using the (con/dis)junctive normal form, although this may result in a sub-optimal FT structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming to Yoked Neural Networks to Improve ANN Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02157v3)** | 2023-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing classical artificial neural networks (ANN) are designed as a tree structure to imitate neural networks. In this paper, we argue that the connectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. The nodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e., these neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a major drawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent years to more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), these methods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, we propose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in the same level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate a neural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the information transfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance of the method. Our YNN can imitate neural networks much better compared with the traditional ANN. In this paper, we analyze the existing structural bias of ANN and propose a model YNN to efficiently eliminate such structural bias. In our model, nodes also carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and edges determine the flow of information. We further impose auxiliary sparsity constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned structure to focus on critical connections. Finally, based on the optimized structure, we also design small neural module structure based on the minimum cut technique to reduce the computational burden of the YNN model. This learning process is compatible with the existing networks and different tasks. The obtained quantitative experimental results reflect that the learned connectivity is superior to the traditional NN structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2008.08261 by other authors</p></details> |

We demonstrate that a nearly identical model architecture (HuBERT) trained with a masked language modeling loss does not exhibit this same ability, suggesting that the visual grounding objective is responsible for the emergence of this phenomenon. We propose the use of a minimum cut algorithm to automatically predict syllable boundaries in speech, followed by a 2-stage clustering method to group identical syllables together. We show that our model not only outperforms a state-of-the-art syllabic segmentation method on the language it was trained on (English), but also generalizes in a zero-shot fashion to Estonian. Finally, we show that the same model is capable of zero-shot generalization for a word segmentation task on 4 other languages from the Zerospeech Challenge, in some cases beating the previous state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Interspeech 2023.

| **[Minimum Cuts in Geometric Intersection Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00858v3)** | 2023-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a set of $n$ disks in the plane. The disk graph $G_\mathcal{D}$ for $\mathcal{D}$ is the undirected graph with vertex set $\mathcal{D}$ in which two disks are joined by an edge if and only if they intersect. The directed transmission graph $G^{\rightarrow}_\mathcal{D}$ for $\mathcal{D}$ is the directed graph with vertex set $\mathcal{D}$ in which there is an edge from a disk $D_1 \in \mathcal{D}$ to a disk $D_2 \in \mathcal{D}$ if and only if $D_1$ contains the center of $D_2$. Given $\mathcal{D}$ and two non-intersecting disks $s, t \in \mathcal{D}$, we show that a minimum $s$-$t$ vertex cut in $G_\mathcal{D}$ or in $G^{\rightarrow}_\mathcal{D}$ can be found in $O(n^{3/2}\text{polylog} n)$ expected time. To obtain our result, we combine an algorithm for the maximum flow problem in general graphs with dynamic geometric data structures to manipulate the disks. As an application, we consider the barrier resilience problem in a rectangular domain. In this problem, we have a vertical strip $S$ bounded by two vertical lines, $L_\ell$ and $L_r$, and a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of disks. Let $a$ be a point in $S$ above all disks of $\mathcal{D}$, and let $b$ a point in $S$ below all disks of $\mathcal{D}$. The task is to find a curve from $a$ to $b$ that lies in $S$ and that intersects as few disks of $\mathcal{D}$ as possible. Using our improved algorithm for minimum cuts in disk graphs, we can solve the barrier resilience problem in $O(n^{3/2}\text{polylog} n)$ expected time.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures; this version corrects a small bug in the proof of Lemma 5.

| **[An Efficient Algorithm for All-Pairs Bounded Edge Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02132v1)** | 2023-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our work concerns algorithms for an unweighted variant of Maximum Flow. In the All-Pairs Connectivity (APC) problem, we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and are tasked with computing the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ (equivalently, the size of a minimum $(s,t)$-cut) in $G$, for all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$. Although over undirected graphs APC can be solved in essentially optimal $n^{2+o(1)}$ time, the true time complexity of APC over directed graphs remains open: this problem can be solved in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time, where $\omega \in [2, 2.373)$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication, but no matching conditional lower bound is known. We study a variant of APC called the $k$-Bounded All Pairs Connectivity ($k$-APC) problem. In this problem, we are given an integer $k$ and graph $G$, and are tasked with reporting the size of a minimum $(s,t)$-cut only for pairs $(s,t)$ of vertices with a minimum cut size less than $k$ (if the minimum $(s,t)$-cut has size at least $k$, we just report it is "large" instead of computing the exact value). We present an algorithm solving $k$-APC in directed graphs in $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time. This runtime is $\tilde O(n^\omega)$ for all $k$ polylogarithmic in $n$, which is essentially optimal under popular conjectures from fine-grained complexity. Previously, this runtime was only known for $k\le 2$ [Georgiadis et al., ICALP 2017]. We also study a variant of $k$-APC, the $k$-Bounded All-Pairs Vertex Connectivity ($k$-APVC) problem, which considers internally vertex-disjoint paths instead of edge-disjoint paths. We present an algorithm solving $k$-APVC in directed graphs in $\tilde{O}(k^2n^\omega)$ time. Previous work solved an easier version of the $k$-APVC problem in $\tilde O((kn)^\omega)$ time [Abboud et al, ICALP 2019].</p></details> |  |
| **[Total Variation Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06218v2)** | 2023-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently proposed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for vertex clustering are trained with an unsupervised minimum cut objective, approximated by a Spectral Clustering (SC) relaxation. However, the SC relaxation is loose and, while it offers a closed-form solution, it also yields overly smooth cluster assignments that poorly separate the vertices. In this paper, we propose a GNN model that computes cluster assignments by optimizing a tighter relaxation of the minimum cut based on graph total variation (GTV). The cluster assignments can be used directly to perform vertex clustering or to implement graph pooling in a graph classification framework. Our model consists of two core components: i) a message-passing layer that minimizes the $\ell_1$ distance in the features of adjacent vertices, which is key to achieving sharp transitions between clusters; ii) an unsupervised loss function that minimizes the GTV of the cluster assignments while ensuring balanced partitions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other GNNs for vertex clustering and graph classification.</p></details> |  |

Recent works revealed that some problems, such as broadcast, breadth-first search, and maximal matching, can be solved with energy-efficient algorithms that consume only $\text{poly} \log n$ energy. However, there exist some problems, such as computing the diameter of the graph, that require $\Omega(n)$ energy to solve. To improve energy efficiency for these problems, we focus on a special graph class: bounded-genus graphs. We present algorithms for computing the exact diameter, the exact global minimum cut size, and a $(1 \pm\epsilon)$-approximate $s$-$t$ minimum cut size with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ energy for bounded-genus graphs. Our approach is based on a generic framework that divides the vertex set into high-degree and low-degree parts and leverages the structural properties of bounded-genus graphs to control the number of certain connected components in the subgraph induced by the low-degree part.</p></details> | <details><summary>Remov...</summary><p>Removing results that were already moved to arXiv:2007.09816.

| **[Massively Parallel Computation in a Heterogeneous Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14692v1)** | 2023-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massively-parallel graph algorithms have received extensive attention over the past decade, with research focusing on three memory regimes: the superlinear regime, the near-linear regime, and the sublinear regime. The sublinear regime is the most desirable in practice, but conditional hardness results point towards its limitations. In this work we study a \emph{heterogeneous} model, where the memory of the machines varies in size. We focus mostly on the heterogeneous setting created by adding a single near-linear machine to the sublinear MPC regime, and show that even a single large machine suffices to circumvent most of the conditional hardness results for the sublinear regime: for graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we give (a) an MST algorithm that runs in $O(\log\log(m/n))$ rounds; (b) an algorithm that constructs an $O(k)$-spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/k})$ in $O(1)$ rounds; and (c) a maximal-matching algorithm that runs in $O(\sqrt{\log(m/n)}\log\log(m/n))$ rounds. We also observe that the best known near-linear MPC algorithms for several other graph problems which are conjectured to be hard in the sublinear regime (minimum cut, maximal independent set, and vertex coloring) can easily be transformed to work in the heterogeneous MPC model with a single near-linear machine, while retaining their original round complexity in the near-linear regime. If the large machine is allowed to have \emph{superlinear} memory, all of the problems above can be solved in $O(1)$ rounds.</p></details> | Appeared in PODC2022 |

However, it has seldom been studied on tetrahedral meshes. Given the merits of using volumetric meshes in applications like brain image analysis, we introduce a novel interpretable graph CNN framework for the tetrahedral mesh structure. Inspired by ChebyNet, our model exploits the volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) to define filters over commonly used graph Laplacian which lacks the Riemannian metric information of 3D manifolds. For pooling adaptation, we introduce new objective functions for localized minimum cuts in the Graclus algorithm based on the LBO. We employ a piece-wise constant approximation scheme that uses the clustering assignment matrix to estimate the LBO on sampled meshes after each pooling. Finally, adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm for tetrahedral meshes, we use the obtained heatmaps to visualize discovered regions-of-interest as biomarkers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on cortical tetrahedral meshes from patients with Alzheimer's disease, as there is scientific evidence showing the correlation of cortical thickness to neurodegenerative disease progression. Our results show the superiority of our LBO-based convolution layer and adapted pooling over the conventionally used unitary cortical thickness, graph Laplacian, and point cloud representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper to Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI 2023) conference</p></details> |

| **[A Nearly Time-Optimal Distributed Approximation of Minimum Cost $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04994v1)** | 2022-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The minimum-cost $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph ($k$-ECSS) problem is a generalization and strengthening of the well-studied minimum-cost spanning tree (MST) problem. While the round complexity of distributedly computing the latter has been well-understood, the former remains mostly open, especially as soon as $k\geq 3$. In this paper, we present the first distributed algorithm that computes an approximation of $k$-ECSS in sublinear time for general $k$. Concretely, we describe a randomized distributed algorithm that, in $\tilde{O}(k(D+k\sqrt{n}))$ rounds, computes a $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph whose cost is within an $O(\log n\log k)$ factor of optimal. Here, $n$ and $D$ denote the number of vertices and diameter of the graph, respectively. This time complexity is nearly optimal for any $k=poly(\log n)$, almost matching an $\tilde{\Omega}(D+\sqrt{n/k})$ lower bound. Our algorithm is the first to achieve a sublinear round complexity for $k\geq 3$. We note that this case is considerably more challenging than the well-studied and well-understood $k=1$ case -- better known as MST -- and the closely related $k=2$ case. Our algorithm is based on reducing the $k$-ECSS problem to $k$ set cover instances, in which we gradually augment the connectivity of the spanning subgraph. To solve each set cover instance, we combine new structural observations on minimum cuts with graph sketching ideas. One key ingredient in our algorithm is a novel structural lemma that allows us to compress the information about all minimum cuts in a graph into a succinct representation, which is computed in a decentralized fashion. We hope that this succinct representation may find applications in other computational settings or for other problems.</p></details> | SODA 2023 |

We study a natural extension called vertex sparsifiers for $c$-hyperedge connectivity and construct a sparsifier whose size matches the state-of-the-art for normal graphs. More specifically, we show that, given a hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ hyperedges with $k$ terminal vertices and a parameter $c$, there exists a hypergraph $H$ containing only $O(kc^{3})$ hyperedges that preserves all minimum cuts (up to value $c$) between all subset of terminals. This matches the best bound of $O(kc^{3})$ edges for normal graphs by [Liu'20(arXiv:2011.15101)]. Moreover, $H$ can be constructed in almost-linear $O(p^{1+o(1)} + n(rc\log n)^{O(rc)}\log m)$ time where $r=\max_{e\in E}|e|$ is the rank of $G$ and $p=\sum_{e\in E}|e|$ is the total size of $G$, or in $\text{poly}(m, n)$ time if we slightly relax the size to $O(kc^{3}\log^{1.5}(kc))$ hyperedges.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ESA 2022</p></details> |

We obtain this result by designing an aggregation-based algorithm: each node receives only an aggregate of the messages sent to it. While somewhat restrictive, recent work shows any such black-box algorithm can be simulated on any minor of the communication network. Furthermore, we observe this also allows for the addition of (a small number of) arbitrarily-connected virtual nodes to the network. We leverage these capabilities to design a min-cut algorithm that is significantly simpler compared to prior distributed work. We hope this paper showcases how working within this paradigm yields simple-to-design and ultra-efficient distributed algorithms for global problems. Our main technical contribution is a distributed algorithm that, given any tree $T$, computes the minimum cut that $2$-respects $T$ (i.e., cuts at most $2$ edges of $T$) in universally near-optimal time. Moreover, our algorithm gives a \emph{deterministic} $\widetilde{O}(D)$-round 2-respecting cut solution for excluded-minor families and a \emph{deterministic} $\widetilde{O}(D + \sqrt{n})$-round solution for general graphs, the latter resolving a question of Dory, et al.~[STOC'21]</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, accepted to PODC 2022</p></details> |
| **[QB-II for Evaluating the Reliability of Binary-State Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14950v1)** | 2022-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current real-life applications of various networks such as utility (gas, water, electric, 4G/5G) networks, the Internet of Things, social networks, and supply chains. Reliability is one of the most popular tools for evaluating network performance. The fundamental structure of these networks is a binary state network. Distinctive methods have been proposed to efficiently assess binary-state network reliability. A new algorithm called QB-II (quick binary-addition tree algorithm II) is proposed to improve the efficiency of quick BAT, which is based on BAT and outperforms many algorithms. The proposed QB-II implements the shortest minimum cuts (MCs) to separate the entire BAT into main-BAT and sub-BATs, and the source-target matrix convolution products to connect these subgraphs intelligently to improve the efficiency. Twenty benchmark problems were used to validate the performance of the QB-II.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Min-cut in Poly-logarithmic Max-flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02008v2)** | 2022-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give a deterministic algorithm for finding the minimum (weight) cut of an undirected graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges using $\text{polylog}(n)$ calls to any maximum flow subroutine. Using the current best deterministic maximum flow algorithms, this yields an overall running time of $\tilde O(m \cdot \min(\sqrt{m}, n^{2/3}))$ for weighted graphs, and $m^{4/3+o(1)}$ for unweighted (multi)-graphs. This marks the first improvement for this problem since a running time bound of $\tilde O(mn)$ was established by several papers in the early 1990s. Our global minimum cut algorithm is obtained as a corollary of a minimum Steiner cut algorithm, where a minimum Steiner cut is a minimum (weight) set of edges whose removal disconnects at least one pair of vertices among a designated set of terminal vertices. The running time of our deterministic minimum Steiner cut algorithm matches that of the global minimum cut algorithm stated above. Using randomization, the running time improves to $m^{1+o(1)}$ because of a faster maximum flow subroutine; this improves the best known randomized algorithm for the minimum Steiner cut problem as well. Our main technical contribution is a new tool that we call *isolating cuts*. Given a set of vertices $R$, this entails finding cuts of minimum weight that separate (or isolate) each individual vertex $v\in R$ from the rest of the vertices $R\setminus \{v\}$. Na\"ively, this can be done using $|R|$ maximum flow calls, but we show that just $O(\log |R|)$ suffice for finding isolating cuts for any set of vertices $R$. We call this the *isolating cut lemma*.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version of FOCS 2020 paper</p></details> |

As a result, it is difficult to choose an ideal algorithm for a given problem. Furthermore, parallel algorithms have not been thoroughly compared. In this paper, we evaluate the state-of-the-art serial and parallel min-cut/max-flow algorithms on the largest set of computer vision problems yet. We focus on generic algorithms, i.e., for unstructured graphs, but also compare with the specialized GridCut implementation. When applicable, GridCut performs best. Otherwise, the two pseudoflow algorithms, Hochbaum pseudoflow and excesses incremental breadth first search, achieves the overall best performance. The most memory efficient implementation tested is the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm. Amongst generic parallel algorithms, we find the bottom-up merging approach by Liu and Sun to be best, but no method is dominant. Of the generic parallel methods, only the parallel preflow push-relabel algorithm is able to efficiently scale with many processors across problem sizes, and no generic parallel method consistently outperforms serial algorithms. Finally, we provide and evaluate strategies for algorithm selection to obtain good expected performance. We make our dataset and implementations publicly available for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication at T-PAMI</p></details> |
| **[A Framework to Design Approximation Algorithms for Finding Diverse Solutions in Combinatorial Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08940v1)** | 2022-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding a \emph{single} best solution is the most common objective in combinatorial optimization problems. However, such a single solution may not be applicable to real-world problems as objective functions and constraints are only "approximately" formulated for original real-world problems. To solve this issue, finding \emph{multiple} solutions is a natural direction, and diversity of solutions is an important concept in this context. Unfortunately, finding diverse solutions is much harder than finding a single solution. To cope with difficulty, we investigate the approximability of finding diverse solutions. As a main result, we propose a framework to design approximation algorithms for finding diverse solutions, which yields several outcomes including constant-factor approximation algorithms for finding diverse matchings in graphs and diverse common bases in two matroids and PTASes for finding diverse minimum cuts and interval schedulings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cut query algorithms with star contraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05674v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of determining the edge connectivity of a simple graph with cut queries. We show that (i) there is a bounded-error randomized algorithm that computes edge connectivity with $O(n)$ cut queries, and (ii) there is a bounded-error quantum algorithm that computes edge connectivity with $\~O(\sqrt{n})$ cut queries. We prove these results using a new technique called "star contraction" to randomly contract edges of a graph while preserving non-trivial minimum cuts. In star contraction vertices randomly contract an edge incident on a small set of randomly chosen vertices. In contrast to the related 2-out contraction technique of Ghaffari, Nowicki, and Thorup [SODA'20], star contraction only contracts vertex-disjoint star subgraphs, which allows it to be efficiently implemented via cut queries. The $O(n)$ bound from item (i) was not known even for the simpler problem of connectivity, and improves the $O(n\log^3 n)$ bound by Rubinstein, Schramm, and Weinberg [ITCS'18]. The bound is tight under the reasonable conjecture that the randomized communication complexity of connectivity is $\Omega(n\log n)$, an open question since the seminal work of Babai, Frankl, and Simon [FOCS'86]. The bound also excludes using edge connectivity on simple graphs to prove a superlinear randomized query lower bound for minimizing a symmetric submodular function. Item (ii) gives a nearly-quadratic separation with the randomized complexity and addresses an open question of Lee, Santha, and Zhang [SODA'21]. The algorithm can also be viewed as making $\~O(\sqrt{n})$ matrix-vector multiplication queries to the adjacency matrix. Finally, we demonstrate the use of star contraction outside of the cut query setting by designing a one-pass semi-streaming algorithm for computing edge connectivity in the vertex arrival setting. This contrasts with the edge arrival setting where two passes are required.</p></details> |  |

This algorithm matches the work bounds of a recent sequential algorithm by Gawrychowski, Mozes, and Weimann [ICALP'20], and improves on the previously best parallel algorithm by Geissmann and Gianinazzi [SPAA'18], which performs $O(m \log^4 n)$ work in $O(\text{polylog } n)$ depth. Our algorithm makes use of three components that might be of independent interest. Firstly, we design a parallel data structure that efficiently supports batched mixed queries and updates on trees. It generalizes and improves the work bounds of a previous data structure of Geissmann and Gianinazzi and is work efficient with respect to the best sequential algorithm. Secondly, we design a parallel algorithm for approximate minimum cut that improves on previous results by Karger and Motwani. We use this algorithm to give a work-efficient procedure to produce a tree packing, as in Karger's sequential algorithm for minimum cuts.

Some of the most efficient algorithms for finding global minimum cuts are randomized algorithms based on Karger's groundbreaking contraction algorithm. Here, we study whether Karger's algorithm can be successfully generalized to other cut problems. We first prove that a wide class of natural generalizations of Karger's algorithm cannot efficiently solve the $s$-$t$-mincut or the normalized cut problem to optimality. However, we then present a simple new algorithm for seeded segmentation / graph-based semi-supervised learning that is closely based on Karger's original algorithm, showing that for these problems, extensions of Karger's algorithm can be useful. The new algorithm has linear asymptotic runtime and yields a potential that can be interpreted as the posterior probability of a sample belonging to a given seed / class. We clarify its relation to the random walker algorithm / harmonic energy minimization in terms of distributions over spanning forests. On classical problems from seeded image segmentation and graph-based semi-supervised learning on image data, the method performs at least as well as the random walker / harmonic energy minimization / Gaussian processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral at ICCV 2021; added acknowledgements</p></details> |
| **[Approximation algorithms for confidence bands for time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06225v1)** | 2021-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidence intervals are a standard technique for analyzing data. When applied to time series, confidence intervals are computed for each time point separately. Alternatively, we can compute confidence bands, where we are required to find the smallest area enveloping $k$ time series, where $k$ is a user parameter. Confidence bands can be then used to detect abnormal time series, not just individual observations within the time series. We will show that despite being an NP-hard problem it is possible to find optimal confidence band for some $k$. We do this by considering a different problem: discovering regularized bands, where we minimize the envelope area minus the number of included time series weighted by a parameter $\alpha$. Unlike normal confidence bands we can solve the problem exactly by using a minimum cut. By varying $\alpha$ we can obtain solutions for various $k$. If we have a constraint $k$ for which we cannot find appropriate $\alpha$, we demonstrate a simple algorithm that yields $O(\sqrt{n})$ approximation guarantee by connecting the problem to a minimum $k$-union problem. This connection also implies that we cannot approximate the problem better than $O(n^{1/4})$ under some (mild) assumptions. Finally, we consider a variant where instead of minimizing the area we minimize the maximum width. Here, we demonstrate a simple 2-approximation algorithm and show that we cannot achieve better approximation guarantee.</p></details> |  |

Very recently, the authors of [AKL+, arXiv v1, 2021] have improved the running time to $\tilde{O}(n^{2.875})$ which breaks the cubic barrier for the first time. In this paper, we refine their approach and improve the running time to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$.

| **[Dynamic Algorithms Against an Adaptive Adversary: Generic Constructions and Lower Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03980v1)** | 2021-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dynamic algorithm against an adaptive adversary is required to be correct when the adversary chooses the next update after seeing the previous outputs of the algorithm. We obtain faster dynamic algorithms against an adaptive adversary and separation results between what is achievable in the oblivious vs. adaptive settings. To get these results we exploit techniques from differential privacy, cryptography, and adaptive data analysis. We give a general reduction transforming a dynamic algorithm against an oblivious adversary to a dynamic algorithm robust against an adaptive adversary. This reduction maintains several copies of the oblivious algorithm and uses differential privacy to protect their random bits. Using this reduction we obtain dynamic algorithms against an adaptive adversary with improved update and query times for global minimum cut, all pairs distances, and all pairs effective resistance. We further improve our update and query times by showing how to maintain a sparsifier over an expander decomposition that can be refreshed fast. This fast refresh enables it to be robust against what we call a blinking adversary that can observe the output of the algorithm only following refreshes. We believe that these techniques will prove useful for additional problems. On the flip side, we specify dynamic problems that, assuming a random oracle, every dynamic algorithm that solves them against an adaptive adversary must be polynomially slower than a rather straightforward dynamic algorithm that solves them against an oblivious adversary. We first show a separation result for a search problem and then show a separation result for an estimation problem. In the latter case our separation result draws from lower bounds in adaptive data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding the KT partition of a weighted graph in near-linear time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01378v1)** | 2021-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a breakthrough work, Kawarabayashi and Thorup (J.~ACM'19) gave a near-linear time deterministic algorithm for minimum cut in a simple graph $G = (V,E)$. A key component is finding the $(1+\varepsilon)$-KT partition of $G$, the coarsest partition $\{P_1, \ldots, P_k\}$ of $V$ such that for every non-trivial $(1+\varepsilon)$-near minimum cut with sides $\{S, \bar{S}\}$ it holds that $P_i$ is contained in either $S$ or $\bar{S}$, for $i=1, \ldots, k$. Here we give a near-linear time randomized algorithm to find the $(1+\varepsilon)$-KT partition of a weighted graph. Our algorithm is quite different from that of Kawarabayashi and Thorup and builds on Karger's framework of tree-respecting cuts (J.~ACM'00). We describe applications of the algorithm. (i) The algorithm makes progress towards a more efficient algorithm for constructing the polygon representation of the set of near-minimum cuts in a graph. This is a generalization of the cactus representation initially described by Bencz\'ur (FOCS'95). (ii) We improve the time complexity of a recent quantum algorithm for minimum cut in a simple graph in the adjacency list model from $\widetilde O(n^{3/2})$ to $\widetilde O(\sqrt{mn})$. (iii) We describe a new type of randomized algorithm for minimum cut in simple graphs with complexity $O(m + n \log^6 n)$. For slightly dense graphs this matches the complexity of the current best $O(m + n \log^2 n)$ algorithm which uses a different approach based on random contractions. The key technical contribution of our work is the following. Given a weighted graph $G$ with $m$ edges and a spanning tree $T$, consider the graph $H$ whose nodes are the edges of $T$, and where there is an edge between two nodes of $H$ iff the corresponding 2-respecting cut of $T$ is a non-trivial near-minimum cut of $G$. We give a $O(m \log^4 n)$ time deterministic algorithm to compute a spanning forest of $H$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Friendly Cut Sparsifiers and Faster Gomory-Hu Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15891v1)** | 2021-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We devise new cut sparsifiers that are related to the classical sparsification of Nagamochi and Ibaraki [Algorithmica, 1992], which is an algorithm that, given an unweighted graph $G$ on $n$ nodes and a parameter $k$, computes a subgraph with $O(nk)$ edges that preserves all cuts of value up to $k$. We put forward the notion of a friendly cut sparsifier, which is a minor of $G$ that preserves all friendly cuts of value up to $k$, where a cut in $G$ is called friendly if every node has more edges connecting it to its own side of the cut than to the other side. We present an algorithm that, given a simple graph $G$, computes in almost-linear time a friendly cut sparsifier with $\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{k})$ edges. Using similar techniques, we also show how, given in addition a terminal set $T$, one can compute in almost-linear time a terminal sparsifier, which preserves the minimum $st$-cut between every pair of terminals, with $\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{k} + |T| k)$ edges. Plugging these sparsifiers into the recent $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithms for constructing a Gomory-Hu tree of simple graphs, along with a relatively simple procedure for handling the unfriendly minimum cuts, we improve the running time for moderately dense graphs (e.g., with $m=n^{1.75}$ edges). In particular, assuming a linear-time Max-Flow algorithm, the new state-of-the-art for Gomory-Hu tree is the minimum between our $(m+n^{1.75})^{1+o(1)}$ and the known $m n^{1/2+o(1)}$. We further investigate the limits of this approach and the possibility of better sparsification. Under the hypothesis that an $\tilde{O}(n)$-edge sparsifier that preserves all friendly minimum $st$-cuts can be computed efficiently, our upper bound improves to $\tilde{O}(m+n^{1.5})$ which is the best possible without breaking the cubic barrier for constructing Gomory-Hu trees in non-simple graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic enumeration of all minimum cut-sets and $k$-cut-sets in hypergraphs for fixed $k$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14815v2)** | 2021-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of deterministically enumerating all minimum $k$-cut-sets in a given hypergraph for any fixed $k$. The input here is a hypergraph $G = (V, E)$ with non-negative hyperedge costs. A subset $F$ of hyperedges is a $k$-cut-set if the number of connected components in $G - F$ is at least $k$ and it is a minimum $k$-cut-set if it has the least cost among all $k$-cut-sets. For fixed $k$, we call the problem of finding a minimum $k$-cut-set as Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and the problem of enumerating all minimum $k$-cut-sets as Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut. The special cases of Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut restricted to graph inputs are well-known to be solvable in (randomized as well as deterministic) polynomial time. In contrast, it is only recently that polynomial-time algorithms for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut were developed. The randomized polynomial-time algorithm for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut that was designed in 2018 (Chandrasekaran, Xu, and Yu, SODA 2018) showed that the number of minimum $k$-cut-sets in a hypergraph is $O(n^{2k-2})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input hypergraph, and that they can all be enumerated in randomized polynomial time, thus resolving Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut in randomized polynomial time. A deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut was subsequently designed in 2020 (Chandrasekaran and Chekuri, FOCS 2020), but it is not guaranteed to enumerate all minimum $k$-cut-sets. In this work, we give the first deterministic polynomial-time algorithm to solve Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut (this is non-trivial even for $k = 2$). Our algorithms are based on new structural results that allow for efficient recovery of all minimum $k$-cut-sets by solving minimum $(S,T)$-terminal cuts. Our techniques give new structural insights even for enumerating all minimum cut-sets (i.e., minimum 2-cut-sets) in a given hypergraph.</p></details> | Accepted to SODA'22 |
| **[The complexity of high-dimensional cuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10195v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cut problems form one of the most fundamental classes of problems in algorithmic graph theory. For instance, the minimum cut, the minimum $s$-$t$ cut, the minimum multiway cut, and the minimum $k$-way cut are some of the commonly encountered cut problems. Many of these problems have been extensively studied over several decades. In this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study of some cut problems in high dimensions. The first problem we study, namely, Topological Hitting Set (THS), is defined as follows: Given a nontrivial $r$-cycle $\zeta$ in a simplicial complex $\mathsf{K}$, find a set $\mathcal{S}$ of $r$-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that $\mathcal{S}$ meets every cycle homologous to $\zeta$. Our main result is that this problem admits a polynomial-time solution on triangulations of closed surfaces. Interestingly, the optimal solution is given in terms of the cocycles of the surface. For general complexes, we show that THS is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size $k$. On the positive side, we show that THS admits an FPT algorithm with respect to $k+d$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the Hasse graph of the complex $\mathsf{K}$. We also define a problem called Boundary Nontrivialization (BNT): Given a bounding $r$-cycle $\zeta$ in a simplicial complex $\mathsf{K}$, find a set $\mathcal{S}$ of $(r+1)$-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that the removal of $\mathcal{S}$ from $\mathsf{K}$ makes $\zeta$ non-bounding. We show that BNT is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size as the parameter, and has an $O(\log n)$-approximation FPT algorithm for $(r+1)$-dimensional complexes with the $(r+1)$-th Betti number $\beta_{r+1}$ as the parameter. Finally, we provide randomized (approximation) FPT algorithms for the global variants of THS and BNT.</p></details> |  |

By viewing flows and cuts topologically in terms of the simplicial (co)boundary operator we can state these problems as linear programs and show that they are dual to one another. Unlike graphs, complexes with integral capacity constraints may have fractional max-flows. We show that computing a maximum integral flow is NP-hard. Moreover, we give a combinatorial definition of a simplicial cut that seems more natural in the context of optimization problems and show that computing such a cut is NP-hard. However, we provide conditions on the simplicial complex for when the cut found by the linear program is a combinatorial cut. For $d$-dimensional simplicial complexes embedded into $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ we provide algorithms operating on the dual graph: computing a maximum flow is dual to computing a shortest path and computing a minimum cut is dual to computing a minimum cost circulation. Finally, we investigate the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on simplicial complexes, prove its correctness, and provide a heuristic which guarantees it to halt.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA) 2021</p></details> |
| **[Low-Congestion Shortcuts in Constant Diameter Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01894v2)** | 2021-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low congestion shortcuts, introduced by Ghaffari and Haeupler (SODA 2016), provide a unified framework for global optimization problems in the congest model of distributed computing. Roughly speaking, for a given graph $G$ and a collection of vertex-disjoint connected subsets $S_1,\ldots, S_\ell \subseteq V(G)$, $(c,d)$ low-congestion shortcuts augment each subgraph $G[S_i]$ with a subgraph $H_i \subseteq G$ such that: (i) each edge appears on at most $c$ subgraphs (congestion bound), and (ii) the diameter of each subgraph $G[S_i] \cup H_i$ is bounded by $d$ (dilation bound). It is desirable to compute shortcuts of small congestion and dilation as these quantities capture the round complexity of many global optimization problems in the congest model. For $n$-vertex graphs with constant diameter $D=O(1)$, Elkin (STOC 2004) presented an (implicit) shortcuts lower bound with $c+d=\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{(D-2)/(2D-2)})$. A nearly matching upper bound, however, was only recently obtained for $D \in \{3,4\}$ by Kitamura et al. (DISC 2019). In this work, we resolve the long-standing complexity gap of shortcuts in constant diameter graphs, originally posed by Lotker et al. (PODC 2001). We present new shortcut constructions which match, up to poly-logarithmic terms, the lower bounds of Das-Sarma et al. As a result, we provide improved and existentially optimal algorithms for several network optimization tasks in constant diameter graphs, including MST, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum cuts and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in PODC 2021</p></details> |
| **[Quantum complexity of minimum cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09823v3)** | 2021-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The minimum cut problem in an undirected and weighted graph $G$ is to find the minimum total weight of a set of edges whose removal disconnects $G$. We completely characterize the quantum query and time complexity of the minimum cut problem in the adjacency matrix model. If $G$ has $n$ vertices and edge weights at least $1$ and at most $\tau$, we give a quantum algorithm to solve the minimum cut problem using $\tilde O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\tau})$ queries and time. Moreover, for every integer $1 \le \tau \le n$ we give an example of a graph $G$ with edge weights $1$ and $\tau$ such that solving the minimum cut problem on $G$ requires $\Omega(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\tau})$ many queries to the adjacency matrix of $G$. These results contrast with the classical randomized case where $\Omega(n^2)$ queries to the adjacency matrix are needed in the worst case even to decide if an unweighted graph is connected or not. In the adjacency array model, when $G$ has $m$ edges the classical randomized complexity of the minimum cut problem is $\tilde \Theta(m)$. We show that the quantum query and time complexity are $\tilde O(\sqrt{mn\tau})$ and $\tilde O(\sqrt{mn\tau} + n^{3/2})$, respectively, where again the edge weights are between $1$ and $\tau$. For dense graphs we give lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ for $\tau > 1$ and $\Omega(\tau n)$ for any $1 \leq \tau \leq n$. Our query algorithm uses a quantum algorithm for graph sparsification by Apers and de Wolf (FOCS 2020) and results on the structure of near-minimum cuts by Kawarabayashi and Thorup (STOC 2015) and Rubinstein, Schramm and Weinberg (ITCS 2018). Our time efficient implementation builds on Karger's tree packing technique (STOC 1996).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages; v2: improved bounds on query and time complexity; v3: fixes typos, accepted to CCC 2021</p></details> |

The capacity of each edge is encoded as an upper bound on the number of state variables that can be communicated instantaneously. When the edge capacities are small compared to the dimensionality of the state vectors, it is not possible to instantaneously communicate full state information over every edge. We investigate how robust consensus (small steady state variance of the states) can be achieved within a linear time-invariant setting by optimally assigning edges to state-dimensions. We show that if a finite steady state variance of the states can be achieved, then both the minimum cut capacity and the total capacity of the network should be sufficiently large. Optimal and approximate solutions are provided for some special classes of graphs. We also consider the related problem of optimally allocating additional capacity on a feasible initial solution. We show that this problem corresponds to the maximization of a submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, which can be approximated via a greedy algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS) and American Control Conference 2021.

| **[Uncertainty in Minimum Cost Multicuts for Image and Motion Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07469v1)** | 2021-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The minimum cost lifted multicut approach has proven practically good performance in a wide range of applications such as image decomposition, mesh segmentation, multiple object tracking, and motion segmentation. It addresses such problems in a graph-based model, where real-valued costs are assigned to the edges between entities such that the minimum cut decomposes the graph into an optimal number of segments. Driven by a probabilistic formulation of minimum cost multicuts, we provide a measure for the uncertainties of the decisions made during the optimization. We argue that access to such uncertainties is crucial for many practical applications and conduct an evaluation by means of sparsifications on three different, widely used datasets in the context of image decomposition (BSDS-500) and motion segmentation (DAVIS2016 and FBMS59) in terms of variation of information (VI) and Rand index (RI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 37th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2021)</p></details> |

| **[Isolating Cuts, (Bi-)Submodularity, and Faster Algorithms for Global Connectivity Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12908v1)** | 2021-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Li and Panigrahi, in recent work, obtained the first deterministic algorithm for the global minimum cut of a weighted undirected graph that runs in time $o(mn)$. They introduced an elegant and powerful technique to find isolating cuts for a terminal set in a graph via a small number of $s$-$t$ minimum cut computations. In this paper we generalize their isolating cut approach to the abstract setting of symmetric bisubmodular functions (which also capture symmetric submodular functions). Our generalization to bisubmodularity is motivated by applications to element connectivity and vertex connectivity. Utilizing the general framework and other ideas we obtain significantly faster randomized algorithms for computing global (and subset) connectivity in a number of settings including hypergraphs, element connectivity and vertex connectivity in graphs, and for symmetric submodular functions.</p></details> |  |

Recently, computational methods were introduced for computing the effective crack energy of periodic and random media. These were based on the continuous minimum cut-maximum flow duality of G. Strang, and made use of discretizations based on trigonometric polynomials and finite elements. For maximum flow problems on graphs, node-based discretization methods avoid metrication artifacts associated to edge-based discretizations. We discretize the minimum cut problem on heterogeneous microstructures by the combinatorial continuous maximum flow discretization introduced by Couprie et al. Furthermore, we introduce an associated FFT-based ADMM solver and provide several adaptive strategies for choosing numerical parameters. We demonstrate the salient features of the proposed approach on problems of industrial scale.</p></details> |  |

For $m\geq n^{1+\epsilon}$ for any constant $\epsilon>0$, our algorithm requires $O(m \log n)$ work and $O(\log^3 n)$ depth and succeeds with high probability. Its work matches the best $O(m \log n)$ runtime for sequential algorithms [MN STOC 2020, GMW SOSA 2021]. This improves the previous best work by Geissmann and Gianinazzi [SPAA 2018] by $O(\log^3 n)$ factor, while matching the depth of their algorithm. To do this, we design a work-efficient approximation algorithm and parallelize the recent sequential algorithms [MN STOC 2020; GMW SOSA 2021] that exploit a connection between 2-respecting minimum cuts and 2-dimensional orthogonal range searching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates on this version: Minor corrections for the previous and our result</p></details> |
| **[Weighted Min-Cut: Sequential, Cut-Query and Streaming Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01651v5)** | 2021-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the following 2-respecting min-cut problem. Given a weighted graph $G$ and its spanning tree $T$, find the minimum cut among the cuts that contain at most two edges in $T$. This problem is an important subroutine in Karger's celebrated randomized near-linear-time min-cut algorithm [STOC'96]. We present a new approach for this problem which can be easily implemented in many settings, leading to the following randomized min-cut algorithms for weighted graphs. * An $O(m\frac{\log^2 n}{\log\log n} + n\log^6 n)$-time sequential algorithm: This improves Karger's $O(m \log^3 n)$ and $O(m\frac{(\log^2 n)\log (n^2/m)}{\log\log n} + n\log^6 n)$ bounds when the input graph is not extremely sparse or dense. Improvements over Karger's bounds were previously known only under a rather strong assumption that the input graph is simple [Henzinger et al. SODA'17; Ghaffari et al. SODA'20]. For unweighted graphs with parallel edges, our bound can be improved to $O(m\frac{\log^{1.5} n}{\log\log n} + n\log^6 n)$. * An algorithm requiring $\tilde O(n)$ cut queries to compute the min-cut of a weighted graph: This answers an open problem by Rubinstein et al. ITCS'18, who obtained a similar bound for simple graphs. * A streaming algorithm that requires $\tilde O(n)$ space and $O(\log n)$ passes to compute the min-cut: The only previous non-trivial exact min-cut algorithm in this setting is the 2-pass $\tilde O(n)$-space algorithm on simple graphs [Rubinstein et al., ITCS'18] (observed by Assadi et al. STOC'19). In contrast to Karger's 2-respecting min-cut algorithm which deploys sophisticated dynamic programming techniques, our approach exploits some cute structural properties so that it only needs to compute the values of $\tilde O(n)$ cuts corresponding to removing $\tilde O(n)$ pairs of tree edges, an operation that can be done quickly in many settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates on this version: (1) Minor corrections in Section 5.1, 5.2; (2) Reference to newer results by GMW SOSA21 (arXiv:2008.02060v2), DEMN STOC21 (arXiv:2004.09129v2) and LMN 21 (arXiv:2102.06565v1)</p></details> |

While there has been theoretical work on this problem, our algorithm is the first implementation of a fully-dynamic algorithm. The algorithm uses the theoretical foundation and combines it with efficient and finely-tuned implementations to give an algorithm that can maintain the global minimum cut of a graph with rapid update times. We show that our algorithm gives up to multiple orders of magnitude speedup compared to static approaches both on edge insertions and deletions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Bots and Assessing Their Impact in Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12398v5)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online social networks are often subject to influence campaigns by malicious actors through the use of automated accounts known as bots. We consider the problem of detecting bots in online social networks and assessing their impact on the opinions of individuals. We begin by analyzing the behavior of bots in social networks and identify that they exhibit heterophily, meaning they interact with humans more than other bots. We use this property to develop a detection algorithm based on the Ising model from statistical physics. The bots are identified by solving a minimum cut problem. We show that this Ising model algorithm can identify bots with higher accuracy while utilizing much less data than other state of the art methods. We then develop a a function we call generalized harmonic influence centrality to estimate the impact bots have on the opinions of users in social networks. This function is based on a generalized opinion dynamics model and captures how the activity level and network connectivity of the bots shift equilibrium opinions. To apply generalized harmonic influence centrality to real social networks, we develop a deep neural network to measure the opinions of users based on their social network posts. Using this neural network, we then calculate the generalized harmonic influence centrality of bots in multiple real social networks. For some networks we find that a limited number of bots can cause non-trivial shifts in the population opinions. In other networks, we find that the bots have little impact. Overall we find that generalized harmonic influence centrality is a useful operational tool to measure the impact of bots in social networks.</p></details> | 58 pages, 11 figures |
| **[On the cut dimension of a graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05085v2)** | 2020-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $G = (V,w)$ be a weighted undirected graph with $m$ edges. The cut dimension of $G$ is the dimension of the span of the characteristic vectors of the minimum cuts of $G$, viewed as vectors in $\{0,1\}^m$. For every $n \ge 2$ we show that the cut dimension of an $n$-vertex graph is at most $2n-3$, and construct graphs realizing this bound. The cut dimension was recently defined by Graur et al.\ \cite{GPRW20}, who show that the maximum cut dimension of an $n$-vertex graph is a lower bound on the number of cut queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to solve the minimum cut problem on $n$-vertex graphs. For every $n\ge 2$, Graur et al.\ exhibit a graph on $n$ vertices with cut dimension at least $3n/2 -2$, giving the first lower bound larger than $n$ on the deterministic cut query complexity of computing mincut. We observe that the cut dimension is even a lower bound on the number of \emph{linear} queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to solve mincut, where a linear query can ask any vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^{\binom{n}{2}}$ and receives the answer $w^T x$. Our results thus show a lower bound of $2n-3$ on the number of linear queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to solve minimum cut on $n$-vertex graphs, and imply that one cannot show a lower bound larger than this via the cut dimension. We further introduce a generalization of the cut dimension which we call the $\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension. The $\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension is also a lower bound on the number of linear queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to compute minimum cut. It is always at least as large as the cut dimension, and we construct an infinite family of graphs on $n=3k+1$ vertices with $\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension $2n-2$, showing that it can be strictly larger than the cut dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Distributed Weighted Min-Cut in Nearly-Optimal Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09129v2)** | 2020-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimum-weight cut (min-cut) is a basic measure of a network's connectivity strength. While the min-cut can be computed efficiently in the sequential setting [Karger STOC'96], there was no efficient way for a distributed network to compute its own min-cut without limiting the input structure or dropping the output quality: In the standard CONGEST model, existing algorithms with nearly-optimal time (e.g. [Ghaffari, Kuhn, DISC'13; Nanongkai, Su, DISC'14]) can guarantee a solution that is $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation at best while the exact $\tilde O(n^{0.8}D^{0.2} + n^{0.9})$-time algorithm [Ghaffari, Nowicki, Thorup, SODA'20] works only on *simple* networks (no weights and no parallel edges). Here $n$ and $D$ denote the network's number of vertices and hop-diameter, respectively. For the weighted case, the best bound was $\tilde O(n)$ [Daga, Henzinger, Nanongkai, Saranurak, STOC'19]. In this paper, we provide an *exact* $\tilde O(\sqrt n + D)$-time algorithm for computing min-cut on *weighted* networks. Our result improves even the previous algorithm that works only on simple networks. Its time complexity matches the known lower bound up to polylogarithmic factors. At the heart of our algorithm are a clever routing trick and two structural lemmas regarding the structure of a minimum cut of a graph. These two structural lemmas considerably strengthen and generalize the framework of Mukhopadhyay-Nanongkai [STOC'20] and can be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major changes: (i) The fragment decomposition technique is simplified, (ii) Introduction and technical overview have been redone, and (iii) The technical sections have been made simpler for better readability</p></details> |
| **[Parametric Graph Templates: Properties and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07001v1)** | 2020-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical structure and repetition are prevalent in graphs originating from nature or engineering. These patterns can be represented by a class of parametric-structure graphs, which are defined by templates that generate structure by way of repeated instantiation. We propose a class of parametric graph templates that can succinctly represent a wide variety of graphs. Using parametric graph templates, we develop structurally-parametric algorithm variants of maximum flow, minimum cut, and tree subgraph isomorphism. Our algorithms are polynomial time for maximum flow and minimum cut and are fixed-parameter tractable for tree subgraph isomorphism when parameterized by the size of the tree subgraph. By reasoning about the structure of the repeating subgraphs, we avoid explicit construction of the instantiation. Furthermore, we show how parametric graph templates can be recovered from an instantiated graph in quasi-polynomial time when certain parameters of the graph are bounded. Parametric graph templates and the presented algorithmic techniques thus create opportunities for reasoning about the generating structure of a graph, rather than an instance of it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive Random Contraction Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15770v1)** | 2020-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this note, we revisit the recursive random contraction algorithm of Karger and Stein for finding a minimum cut in a graph. Our revisit is occasioned by a paper of Fox, Panigrahi, and Zhang which gives an extension of the Karger-Stein algorithm to minimum cuts and minimum $k$-cuts in hypergraphs. When specialized to the case of graphs, the algorithm is somewhat different than the original Karger-Stein algorithm. We show that the analysis becomes particularly clean in this case: we can prove that the probability that a fixed minimum cut in an $n$ node graph is returned by the algorithm is bounded below by $1/(2H_n-2)$, where $H_n$ is the $n$th harmonic number. We also consider other similar variants of the algorithm, and show that no such algorithm can achieve an asymptotically better probability of finding a fixed minimum cut.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms 2021 (SOSA 2021)</p></details> |
| **[Efficiently Computing Maximum Flows in Scale-Free Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09678v1)** | 2020-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the maximum-flow/minimum-cut problem on scale-free networks, i.e., graphs whose degree distribution follows a power-law. We propose a simple algorithm that capitalizes on the fact that often only a small fraction of such a network is relevant for the flow. At its core, our algorithm augments Dinitz's algorithm with a balanced bidirectional search. Our experiments on a scale-free random network model indicate sublinear run time. On scale-free real-world networks, we outperform the commonly used highest-label Push-Relabel implementation by up to two orders of magnitude. Compared to Dinitz's original algorithm, our modifications reduce the search space, e.g., by a factor of 275 on an autonomous systems graph. Beyond these good run times, our algorithm has an additional advantage compared to Push-Relabel. The latter computes a preflow, which makes the extraction of a minimum cut potentially more difficult. This is relevant, for example, for the computation of Gomory-Hu trees. On a social network with 70000 nodes, our algorithm computes the Gomory-Hu tree in 3 seconds compared to 12 minutes when using Push-Relabel.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query Complexity of Global Minimum Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09202v2)** | 2020-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we resolve the query complexity of global minimum cut problem for a graph by designing a randomized algorithm for approximating the size of minimum cut in a graph, where the graph can be accessed through local queries like {\sc Degree}, {\sc Neighbor}, and {\sc Adjacency} queries. Given $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, the algorithm with high probability outputs an estimate $\hat{t}$ satisfying the following $(1-\epsilon) t \leq \hat{t} \leq (1+\epsilon) t$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $t$ is the size of minimum cut in the graph. The expected number of local queries used by our algorithm is $\min\left\{m+n,\frac{m}{t}\right\}\mbox{poly}\left(\log n,\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Eden and Rosenbaum showed that $\Omega(m/t)$ many local queries are required for approximating the size of minimum cut in graphs. These two results together resolve the query complexity of the problem of estimating the size of minimum cut in graphs using local queries. Building on the lower bound of Eden and Rosenbaum, we show that, for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to decide if the size of the minimum cut in the graph is $t$ or $t-2$. Also, we show that, for any $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to find all the minimum cut edges even if it is promised that the input graph has a minimum cut of size $t$. Both of our lower bound results are randomized, and hold even if we can make {\sc Random Edge} query apart from local queries.</p></details> | 15 pages |
