| **[Constrained Bandwidth Observation Sharing for Multi-Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Intelligent Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09975v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation is increasingly crucial in various domains, including disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse and manufacturing automation. Robot teams often must operate in highly dynamic environments and under strict bandwidth constraints imposed by communication infrastructure, rendering effective observation sharing within the system a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel optimal communication scheme, Intelligent Knapsack (iKnap), for multi-robot navigation in dynamic environments under bandwidth constraints. We model multi-robot communication as belief propagation in a graph of inferential agents. We then formulate the combinatorial optimization for observation sharing as a 0/1 knapsack problem, where each potential pairwise communication between robots is assigned a decision-making utility to be weighed against its bandwidth cost, and the system has some cumulative bandwidth limit. We evaluate our approach in a simulated robotic warehouse with human workers using ROS2 and the Open Robotics Middleware Framework. Compared to state-of-the-art broadcast-based optimal communication schemes, iKnap yields significant improvements in navigation performance with respect to scenario complexity while maintaining a similar runtime. Furthermore, iKnap utilizes allocated bandwidth and observational resources more efficiently than existing approaches, especially in very low-resource and high-uncertainty settings. Based on these results, we claim that the proposed method enables more robust collaboration for multi-robot teams in real-world navigation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sum-Of-Squares To Approximate Knapsack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13292v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>These notes give a self-contained exposition of Karlin, Mathieu and Nguyen's tight estimate of the integrality gap of the sum-of-squares semidefinite program for solving the knapsack problem. They are based on a sequence of three lectures in CMU course on Advanced Approximation Algorithms in Fall'21 that used the KMN result to introduce the Sum-of-Squares method for algorithm design. The treatment in these notes uses the pseudo-distribution view of solutions to the sum-of-squares SDPs and only rely on a few basic, reusable results about pseudo-distributions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Faster Global Minimum Cut with Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05004v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global minimum cut is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem with wide-ranging applications. Often in practice, these problems are solved repeatedly on families of similar or related instances. However, the de facto algorithmic approach is to solve each instance of the problem from scratch discarding information from prior instances. In this paper, we consider how predictions informed by prior instances can be used to warm-start practical minimum cut algorithms. The paper considers the widely used Karger's algorithm and its counterpart, the Karger-Stein algorithm. Given good predictions, we show these algorithms become near-linear time and have robust performance to erroneous predictions. Both of these algorithms are randomized edge-contraction algorithms. Our natural idea is to probabilistically prioritize the contraction of edges that are unlikely to be in the minimum cut.</p></details> |  |
| **[An O(log n)-Approximation Algorithm for (p,q)-Flexible Graph Connectivity via Independent Rounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12549v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the $(p,q)$-Flexible Graph Connectivity problem, the input is a graph $G = (V,E)$ with the edge set $E = \mathscr{S} \cup \mathscr{U}$ partitioned into safe and unsafe edges, and the goal is to find a minimum cost set of edges $F$ such that the subgraph $(V,F)$ remains $p$-edge-connected after removing any $q$ unsafe edges from $F$. We give a new integer programming formulation for the problem, by adding knapsack cover constraints to the $p(p+q)$-connected capacitated edge-connectivity formulation studied in previous work, and show that the corresponding linear relaxation can be solved in polynomial time by giving an efficient separation oracle. Further, we show that independent randomized rounding yields an $O(\log n)$-approximation for arbitrary values of $p$ and $q$, improving the state-of-the-art $O(q\log n)$. For both separation and rounding, a key insight is to use Karger's bound on the number of near-minimum cuts.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Fully Dynamic Approximate Minimum Cut in Subpolynomial Time per Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15069v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamically maintaining the minimum cut in a graph $G$ under edge insertions and deletions is a fundamental problem in dynamic graph algorithms for which no conditional lower bound on the time per operation exists. In an $n$-node graph the best known $(1+o(1))$-approximate algorithm takes $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$ update time [Thorup 2007]. If the minimum cut is guaranteed to be $(\log n)^{o(1)}$, a deterministic exact algorithm with $n^{o(1)}$ update time exists [Jin, Sun, Thorup 2024]. We present the first fully dynamic algorithm for $(1+o(1))$-approximate minimum cut with $n^{o(1)}$ update time. Our main technical contribution is to show that it suffices to consider small-volume cuts in suitably contracted graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SODA2025</p></details> |
| **[Space Complexity of Minimum Cut Problems in Single-Pass Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01143v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of finding a minimum cut of a weighted graph presented as a single-pass stream. While graph sparsification in streams has been intensively studied, the specific application of finding minimum cuts in streams is less well-studied. To this end, we show upper and lower bounds on minimum cut problems in insertion-only streams for a variety of settings, including for both randomized and deterministic algorithms, for both arbitrary and random order streams, and for both approximate and exact algorithms. One of our main results is an $\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ space algorithm with fast update time for approximating a spectral cut query with high probability on a stream given in an arbitrary order. Our result breaks the $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$ space lower bound required of a sparsifier that approximates all cuts simultaneously. Using this result, we provide streaming algorithms with near optimal space of $\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ for minimum cut and approximate all-pairs effective resistances, with matching space lower-bounds. The amortized update time of our algorithms is $\widetilde{O}(1)$, provided that the number of edges in the input graph is at least $(n/\varepsilon^2)^{1+o(1)}$. We also give a generic way of incorporating sketching into a recursive contraction algorithm to improve the post-processing time of our algorithms. In addition to these results, we give a random-order streaming algorithm that computes the {\it exact} minimum cut on a simple, unweighted graph using $\widetilde{O}(n)$ space. Finally, we give an $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$ space lower bound for deterministic minimum cut algorithms which matches the best-known upper bound up to polylogarithmic factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>25+3 ...</summary><p>25+3 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Tree-Packing Revisited: Faster Fully Dynamic Min-Cut and Arboricity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09141v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A tree-packing is a collection of spanning trees of a graph. It has been a useful tool for computing the minimum cut in static, dynamic, and distributed settings. In particular, [Thorup, Comb. 2007] used them to obtain his dynamic min-cut algorithm with $\tilde O(\lambda^{14.5}\sqrt{n})$ worst-case update time. We reexamine this relationship, showing that we need to maintain fewer spanning trees for such a result; we show that we only need to pack $\Theta(\lambda^3 \log m)$ greedy trees to guarantee a 1-respecting cut or a trivial cut in some contracted graph. Based on this structural result, we then provide a deterministic algorithm for fully dynamic exact min-cut, that has $\tilde O(\lambda^{5.5}\sqrt{n})$ worst-case update time, for min-cut value bounded by $\lambda$. In particular, this also leads to an algorithm for general fully dynamic exact min-cut with $\tilde O(m^{1-1/12})$ amortized update time, improving upon $\tilde O(m^{1-1/31})$ [Goranci et al., SODA 2023]. We also give the first fully dynamic algorithm that maintains a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the fractional arboricity -- which is strictly harder than the integral arboricity. Our algorithm is deterministic and has $O(\alpha \log^6m/\varepsilon^4)$ amortized update time, for arboricity at most $\alpha$. We extend these results to a Monte Carlo algorithm with $O(\text{poly}(\log m,\varepsilon^{-1}))$ amortized update time against an adaptive adversary. Our algorithms work on multi-graphs as well. Both result are obtained by exploring the connection between the min-cut/arboricity and (greedy) tree-packing. We investigate tree-packing in a broader sense; including a lower bound for greedy tree-packing, which - to the best of our knowledge - is the first progress on this topic since [Thorup, Comb. 2007].</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SODA '25</p></details> |
| **[Approximating the Held-Karp Bound for Metric TSP in Nearly Linear Work and Polylogarithmic Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14745v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a nearly linear work parallel algorithm for approximating the Held-Karp bound for the Metric TSP problem. Given an edge-weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ on $m$ edges and $\epsilon>0$, it returns a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the Held-Karp bound with high probability, in $\tilde{O}(m/\epsilon^4)$ work and $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ depth. While a nearly linear time sequential algorithm was known for almost a decade (Chekuri and Quanrud'17), it was not known how to simultaneously achieve nearly linear work alongside polylogarithmic depth. Using a reduction by Chalermsook et al.'22, we also give a parallel algorithm for computing a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate fractional solution to the $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph (kECSS) problem, with the same complexity. To obtain these results, we introduce a notion of core-sequences for the parallel Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) framework (Luby-Nisan'93, Young'01). For the Metric TSP and kECSS problems, core-sequences enable us to exploit the structure of approximate minimum cuts to reduce the cost per iteration and/or the number of iterations. The acceleration technique via core-sequences is generic and of independent interest. In particular, it improves the best-known iteration complexity of MWU algorithms for packing/covering LPs from $poly(\log nnz(A))$ to polylogarithmic in the product of cardinalities of the core-sequence sets where $A$ is the constraint matrix of the LP. For certain implicitly defined LPs such as the kECSS LP, this yields an exponential improvement in depth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear-Time Algorithms for k-Edge-Connected Components, k-Lean Tree Decompositions, and More](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02658v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithms for various problems about decomposing a given undirected graph by edge cuts or vertex separators of size $<k$ into parts that are ``well-connected'' with respect to cuts or separators of size $<k$; here, $m$ is the total number of vertices and edges of the graph. As an application of our results, we obtain for every fixed $k$ a linear-time algorithm for computing the $k$-edge-connected components of a given graph, solving a long-standing open problem. More generally, we obtain a $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithm for computing a $k$-Gomory-Hu tree of a given graph, which is a structure representing pairwise minimum cuts of size $<k$. Our main technical result, from which the other results follow, is a $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithm for computing a $k$-lean tree decomposition of a given graph. This is a tree decomposition with adhesion size $<k$ that captures the existence of separators of size $<k$ between subsets of its bags. A $k$-lean tree decomposition is also an unbreakable tree decomposition with optimal unbreakability parameters for the adhesion size bound $k$. As further applications, we obtain $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithms for $k$-vertex connectivity and for element connectivity $k$-Gomory-Hu tree. All of our algorithms are deterministic. Our techniques are inspired by the tenth paper of the Graph Minors series of Robertson and Seymour and by Bodlaender's parameterized linear-time algorithm for treewidth.</p></details> | 107 pages |
| **[A Simpler Approach for Monotone Parametric Minimum Cut: Finding the Breakpoints in Order](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15920v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present parametric breadth-first search (PBFS), a new algorithm for solving the parametric minimum cut problem in a network with source-sink-monotone capacities. The objective is to find the set of breakpoints, i.e., the points at which the minimum cut changes. It is well known that this problem can be solved in the same asymptotic runtime as the static minimum cut problem. However, existing algorithms that achieve this runtime bound involve fairly complicated steps that are inefficient in practice. PBFS uses a simpler approach that discovers the breakpoints in ascending order, which allows it to achieve the desired runtime bound while still performing well in practice. We evaluate our algorithm on benchmark instances from polygon aggregation and computer vision. Polygon aggregation was recently proposed as an application for parametric minimum cut, but the monotonicity property has not been exploited fully. PBFS outperforms the state of the art on most benchmark instances, usually by a factor of 2-3. It is particularly strong on instances with many breakpoints, which is the case for polygon aggregation. Compared to the existing min-cut-based approach for polygon aggregation, PBFS scales much better with the instance size. On large instances with millions of vertices, it is able to compute all breakpoints in a matter of seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Cuts with Arbitrary Size Constraints Through Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04732v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common way of partitioning graphs is through minimum cuts. One drawback of classical minimum cut methods is that they tend to produce small groups, which is why more balanced variants such as normalized and ratio cuts have seen more success. However, we believe that with these variants, the balance constraints can be too restrictive for some applications like for clustering of imbalanced datasets, while not being restrictive enough for when searching for perfectly balanced partitions. Here, we propose a new graph cut algorithm for partitioning graphs under arbitrary size constraints. We formulate the graph cut problem as a Gromov-Wasserstein with a concave regularizer problem. We then propose to solve it using an accelerated proximal GD algorithm which guarantees global convergence to a critical point, results in sparse solutions and only incurs an additional ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ compared to the classical spectral clustering algorithm but was seen to be more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Sensitivity Oracle for Steiner Mincut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17715v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected weighted graph on $n=|V|$ vertices and $S\subseteq V$ be a Steiner set. Steiner mincut is a well-studied concept, which provides a generalization to both (s,t)-mincut (when $|S|=2$) and global mincut (when $|S|=n$). Here, we address the problem of designing a compact data structure that can efficiently report a Steiner mincut and its capacity after the failure of any edge in $G$; such a data structure is known as a \textit{Sensitivity Oracle} for Steiner mincut. In the area of minimum cuts, although many Sensitivity Oracles have been designed in unweighted graphs, however, in weighted graphs, Sensitivity Oracles exist only for (s,t)-mincut [Annals of Operations Research 1991, NETWORKS 2019, ICALP 2024], which is just a special case of Steiner mincut. Here, we generalize this result to any arbitrary set $S\subseteq V$. 1. Sensitivity Oracle: Assuming the capacity of every edge is known, a. there is an ${\mathcal O}(n)$ space data structure that can report the capacity of Steiner mincut in ${\mathcal O}(1)$ time and b. there is an ${\mathcal O}(n(n-|S|+1))$ space data structure that can report a Steiner mincut in ${\mathcal O}(n)$ time after the failure of any edge in $G$. 2. Lower Bound: We show that any data structure that, after the failure of any edge, can report a Steiner mincut or its capacity must occupy $\Omega(n^2)$ bits of space in the worst case, irrespective of the size of the Steiner set. The lower bound in (2) shows that the assumption in (1) is essential to break the $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on space. For $|S|=n-k$ for any constant $k\ge 0$, it occupies only ${\mathcal O}(n)$ space. So, we also present the first Sensitivity Oracle occupying ${\mathcal O}(n)$ space for global mincut.</p></details> |  |

It is a hypergraph preserving the minimum multicut values of any set of pairs over $T$ where the value is at most $c$. This is a new variant of the multicut-mimicking network of a graph in [Wahlstr\"om ICALP'20], which introduces a parameter $c$ and extends it to handle hypergraphs. Additionally, it is a natural extension of the \emph{connectivity-$c$ mimicking network} introduced by [Chalermsook et al. SODA'21] and [Jiang et al. ESA'22] that is a (hyper)graph preserving the minimum cut values between two subsets of terminals where the value is at most $c$. We propose an algorithm for a hypergraph that returns a multicut-mimicking network over terminals $T$ with a parameter $c$ having $|T|c^{O(r\log c)}$ hyperedges in $p^{1+o(1)}+|T|(c^r\log n)^{\tilde{O}(rc)}m$ time, where $p$ and $r$ are the total size and the rank, respectively, of the hypergraph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear in proceedings of ISAAC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Finding Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07290v3)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many studies have been devoted to finding diverse solutions in classical combinatorial problems, such as Vertex Cover (Baste et al., IJCAI'20), Matching (Fomin et al., ISAAC'20) and Spanning Tree (Hanaka et al., AAAI'21). We initiate the algorithmic study of $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts which, given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, two specified vertices $s,t \in V$, and an integer $k > 0$, asks for a collection of $k$ minimum $s$-$t$ cuts in $G$ that has maximum diversity. We investigate the complexity of the problem for maximizing three diversity measures that can be applied to a collection of cuts: (i) the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances, (ii) the cardinality of the union of cuts in the collection, and (iii) the minimum pairwise Hamming distance. We prove that $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts can be solved in strongly polynomial time for diversity measures (i) and (ii) via submodular function minimization. We obtain this result by establishing a connection between ordered collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts and the theory of distributive lattices. When restricted to finding only collections of mutually disjoint solutions, we provide a more practical algorithm that finds a maximum set of pairwise disjoint minimum $s$-$t$ cuts. For graphs with small minimum $s$-$t$ cut, it runs in the time of a single max-flow computation. Our results stand in contrast to the problem of finding $k$ diverse global minimum cuts -- which is known to be NP-hard even for the disjoint case (Hanaka et al., AAAI'23) -- and partially answer a long-standing open question of Wagner (Networks, 1990) about improving the complexity of finding disjoint collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts. Lastly, we show that $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts subject to diversity measure (iii) is NP-hard already for $k=3$.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ea...</summary><p>An earlier version of this work appeared at the 34th International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2023).

| **[The Parameterized Complexity Landscape of Two-Sets Cut-Uncut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13543v1)** | 2024-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Two-Sets Cut-Uncut, we are given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and two terminal sets $S$ and $T$. The task is to find a minimum cut $C$ in $G$ (if there is any) separating $S$ from $T$ under the following ``uncut'' condition. In the graph $(V,E \setminus C)$, the terminals in each terminal set remain in the same connected component. In spite of the superficial similarity to the classic problem Minimum $s$-$t$-Cut, Two-Sets Cut-Uncut is computationally challenging. In particular, even deciding whether such a cut of any size exists, is already NP-complete. We initiate a systematic study of Two-Sets Cut-Uncut within the context of parameterized complexity. By leveraging known relations between many well-studied graph parameters, we characterize the structural properties of input graphs that allow for polynomial kernels, fixed-parameter tractability (FPT), and slicewise polynomial algorithms (XP). Our main contribution is the near-complete establishment of the complexity of these algorithmic properties within the described hierarchy of graph parameters. On a technical level, our main results are fixed-parameter tractability for the (vertex-deletion) distance to cographs and an OR-cross composition excluding polynomial kernels for the vertex cover number of the input graph (under the standard complexity assumption NP is not contained in coNP/poly).</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional limits of graph cuts on discretized grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15297v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph cuts are among the most prominent tools for clustering and classification analysis. While intensively studied from geometric and algorithmic perspectives, graph cut-based statistical inference still remains elusive to a certain extent. Distributional limits are fundamental in understanding and designing such statistical procedures on randomly sampled data. We provide explicit limiting distributions for balanced graph cuts in general on a fixed but arbitrary discretization. In particular, we show that Minimum Cut, Ratio Cut and Normalized Cut behave asymptotically as the minimum of Gaussians as sample size increases. Interestingly, our results reveal a dichotomy for Cheeger Cut: The limiting distribution of the optimal objective value is the minimum of Gaussians only when the optimal partition yields two sets of unequal volumes, while otherwise the limiting distribution is the minimum of a random mixture of Gaussians. Further, we show the bootstrap consistency for all types of graph cuts by utilizing the directional differentiability of cut functionals. We validate these theoretical findings by Monte Carlo experiments, and examine differences between the cuts and the dependency on the underlying distribution. Additionally, we expand our theoretical findings to the Xist algorithm, a computational surrogate of graph cuts recently proposed in Suchan, Li and Munk (arXiv, 2023), thus demonstrating the practical applicability of our findings e.g. in statistical tests.</p></details> | 59 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Interdiction of minimum spanning trees and other matroid bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14906v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the minimum spanning tree (MST) interdiction problem, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge weights, and want to find some $X\subseteq E$ satisfying a knapsack constraint such that the MST weight in $(V,E\setminus X)$ is maximized. Since MSTs of $G$ are the minimum weight bases in the graphic matroid of $G$, this problem is a special case of matroid interdiction on a matroid $M=(E,\mathcal{I})$, in which the objective is instead to maximize the minimum weight of a basis of $M$ which is disjoint from $X$. By reduction from 0-1 knapsack, matroid interdiction is NP-complete, even for uniform matroids. We develop a new exact algorithm to solve the matroid interdiction problem. One of the key components of our algorithm is a dynamic programming upper bound which only requires that a simpler discrete derivative problem can be calculated/approximated for the given matroid. Our exact algorithm then uses this bound within a custom branch-and-bound algorithm. For different matroids, we show how this discrete derivative can be calculated/approximated. In particular, for partition matroids, this yields a pseudopolynomial time algorithm. For graphic matroids, an approximation can be obtained by solving a sequence of minimum cut problems, which we apply to the MST interdiction problem. The running time of our algorithm is asymptotically faster than the best known MST interdiction algorithm, up to polylog factors. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art computational performance: we solved all available instances from the literature, and in many cases reduced the best running time from hours to seconds.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Tight Lower Bounds for Directed Cut Sparsification and Distributed Min-Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13231v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider two fundamental cut approximation problems on large graphs. We prove new lower bounds for both problems that are optimal up to logarithmic factors. The first problem is to approximate cuts in balanced directed graphs. In this problem, the goal is to build a data structure that $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-approximates cut values in graphs with $n$ vertices. For arbitrary directed graphs, such a data structure requires $\Omega(n^2)$ bits even for constant $\epsilon$. To circumvent this, recent works study $\beta$-balanced graphs, meaning that for every directed cut, the total weight of edges in one direction is at most $\beta$ times that in the other direction. We consider two models: the {\em for-each} model, where the goal is to approximate each cut with constant probability, and the {\em for-all} model, where all cuts must be preserved simultaneously. We improve the previous $\Omega(n \sqrt{\beta/\epsilon})$ lower bound to $\tilde{\Omega}(n \sqrt{\beta}/\epsilon)$ in the for-each model, and we improve the previous $\Omega(n \beta/\epsilon)$ lower bound to $\Omega(n \beta/\epsilon^2)$ in the for-all model. This resolves the main open questions of (Cen et al., ICALP, 2021). The second problem is to approximate the global minimum cut in a local query model, where we can only access the graph via degree, edge, and adjacency queries. We improve the previous $\Omega\bigl(\frac{m}{k}\bigr)$ query complexity lower bound to $\Omega\bigl(\min\{m, \frac{m}{\epsilon^2 k}\}\bigr)$ for this problem, where $m$ is the number of edges, $k$ is the size of the minimum cut, and we seek a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation. In addition, we show that existing upper bounds with slight modifications match our lower bound up to logarithmic factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Broadcast in Highly Connected Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12930v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the classic broadcast problem, wherein we have $k$ messages, each composed of $O(\log{n})$ bits, distributed arbitrarily across a network. The objective is to broadcast these messages to all nodes in the network. In the distributed CONGEST model, a textbook algorithm solves this problem in $O(D+k)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph. While the $O(D)$ term in the round complexity is unavoidable$\unicode{x2014}$given that $\Omega(D)$ rounds are necessary to solve broadcast in any graph$\unicode{x2014}$it remains unclear whether the $O(k)$ term is needed in all graphs. In cases where the minimum cut size is one, simply transmitting messages from one side of the cut to the other would require $\Omega(k)$ rounds. However, if the size of the minimum cut is larger, it may be possible to develop faster algorithms. This motivates the exploration of the broadcast problem in networks with high edge connectivity. In this work, we present a simple randomized distributed algorithm for performing $k$-message broadcast in $O(((n+k)/\lambda)\log n)$ rounds in any $n$-node simple graph with edge connectivity $\lambda$. When $k = \Omega(n)$, our algorithm is universally optimal, up to an $O(\log n)$ factor, as its complexity nearly matches an information-theoretic $\Omega(k/\lambda)$ lower bound that applies to all graphs, even when the network topology is known to the algorithm. The setting $k = \Omega(n)$ is particularly interesting because several fundamental problems can be reduced to broadcasting $\Omega(n)$ messages. Our broadcast algorithm finds several applications in distributed computing, enabling $O(1)$-approximation for all distances and $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for all cut sizes in $\tilde{O}(n/\lambda)$ rounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering A Workload-balanced Push-Relabel Algorithm for Massive Graphs on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00270v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The push-relabel algorithm is an efficient algorithm that solves the maximum flow/ minimum cut problems of its affinity to parallelization. As the size of graphs grows exponentially, researchers have used Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the computation of the push-relabel algorithm further. However, prior works need to handle the significant memory consumption to represent a massive residual graph. In addition, the nature of their algorithms has inherently imbalanced workload distribution on GPUs. This paper first identifies the two challenges with the memory and computational models. Based on the analysis of these models, we propose a workload-balanced push-relabel algorithm (WBPR) with two enhanced compressed sparse representations (CSR) and a vertex-centric approach. The enhanced CSR significantly reduces memory consumption, while the vertex-centric approach alleviates the workload imbalance and improves the utilization of the GPU. In the experiment, our approach reduces the memory consumption from O(V^2) to O(V + E). Moreover, we can achieve up to 7.31x and 2.29x runtime speedup compared to the state-of-the-art on real-world graphs in maximum flow and bipartite matching tasks, respectively.

Finding such a cut is a classic problem that is dual to that of finding a maximum flow from $s$ to $t$. In this work we describe a quantum algorithm for the minimum $s{\operatorname{-}}t$ cut problem on undirected graphs. For an undirected graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and integral edge weights bounded by $W$, the algorithm computes with high probability the weight of a minimum $s{\operatorname{-}}t$ cut after $\widetilde O(\sqrt{m} n^{5/6} W^{1/3})$ queries to the adjacency list of $G$. For simple graphs this bound is always $\widetilde O(n^{11/6})$, even in the dense case when $m = \Omega(n^2)$. In contrast, a randomized algorithm must make $\Omega(m)$ queries to the adjacency list of a simple graph $G$ even to decide whether $s$ and $t$ are connected.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The proof of the upper bound on the time complexity in the first arXiv version contained a fatal flaw.

| **[Cactus Representation of Minimum Cuts: Derandomize and Speed up](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10856v1)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an undirected weighted graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we give the first deterministic $m^{1+o(1)}$-time algorithm for constructing the cactus representation of \emph{all} global minimum cuts. This improves the current $n^{2+o(1)}$-time state-of-the-art deterministic algorithm, which can be obtained by combining ideas implicitly from three papers [Karger JACM'2000, Li STOC'2021, and Gabow TALG'2016] The known explicitly stated deterministic algorithm has a runtime of $\tilde{O}(mn)$ [Fleischer 1999, Nagamochi and Nakao 2000]. Using our technique, we can even speed up the fastest randomized algorithm of [Karger and Panigrahi, SODA'2009] whose running time is at least $\Omega(m\log^4 n)$ to $O(m\log^3 n)$.</p></details> | SODA 2024 |

| **[Detachment Problem -- Application in Prevention of Information Leakage in Stock Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07074v1)** | 2024-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Detachment Problem. It can be seen as a generalized Vaccination Problem. The aim is to optimally cut the individuals' ties to circles that connect them to others, to minimize the overall information transfer in a social network. When an individual is isolated from a particular circle, it leads to the elimination of the connections to all the members of that circle, yet the connections to other circles remain. This approach contrasts with the conventional vaccination problem, in which a subset of vertices is totally eliminated. In our case, the connections of individuals to their circles are selectively, rather than entirely, eliminated. Contextually, this article focuses on private information flows, specifically within networks formed by memberships in circles of insiders in companies. Our quasi-empirical study uses simulated information flows on an observable network, and the statistical properties of the simulated information flows are matched with real-world data. In a broader context, this paper presents the Detachment Problem as a versatile approach for optimal social distancing, applicable across various scenarios. We propose and define a concept of expected proportional outside influence, or EPOI, as measure of how widespread information leak is. We also implement a greedy algorithm for finding a set of detachments to minimize EPOI. For comparison, we devise a simple heuristic based on minimal cut, to separate the most influential circles from each other. We provide evidence that the greedy algorithm is not optimal, and it is sometimes outperformed by the simple heuristic minimum cut algorithm, However, the greedy algorithm outperforms the cut algorithm in most cases. Further avenues of research are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Near-Linear Time Minimum Cut in Weighted Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05627v1)** | 2024-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 1996, Karger [Kar96] gave a startling randomized algorithm that finds a minimum-cut in a (weighted) graph in time $O(m\log^3n)$ which he termed near-linear time meaning linear (in the size of the input) times a polylogarthmic factor. In this paper, we give the first deterministic algorithm which runs in near-linear time for weighted graphs. Previously, the breakthrough results of Kawarabayashi and Thorup [KT19] gave a near-linear time algorithm for simple graphs. The main technique here is a clustering procedure that perfectly preserves minimum cuts. Recently, Li [Li21] gave an $m^{1+o(1)}$ deterministic minimum-cut algorithm for weighted graphs; this form of running time has been termed "almost-linear''. Li uses almost-linear time deterministic expander decompositions which do not perfectly preserve minimum cuts, but he can use these clusterings to, in a sense, "derandomize'' the methods of Karger. In terms of techniques, we provide a structural theorem that says there exists a sparse clustering that preserves minimum cuts in a weighted graph with $o(1)$ error. In addition, we construct it deterministically in near linear time. This was done exactly for simple graphs in [KT19, HRW20] and with polylogarithmic error for weighted graphs in [Li21]. Extending the techniques in [KT19, HRW20] to weighted graphs presents significant challenges, and moreover, the algorithm can only polylogarithmically approximately preserve minimum cuts. A remaining challenge is to reduce the polylogarithmic-approximate clusterings to $1+o(1/\log n)$-approximate so that they can be applied recursively as in [Li21] over $O(\log n)$ many levels. This is an additional challenge that requires building on properties of tree-packings in the presence of a wide range of edge weights to, for example, find sources for local flow computations which identify minimum cuts that cross clusters.</p></details> | SODA 2024, 60 pages |
| **[Robust Zero Level-Set Extraction from Unsigned Distance Fields Based on Double Covering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03431v3)** | 2024-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new method, called DoubleCoverUDF, for extracting the zero level-set from unsigned distance fields (UDFs). DoubleCoverUDF takes a learned UDF and a user-specified parameter $r$ (a small positive real number) as input and extracts an iso-surface with an iso-value $r$ using the conventional marching cubes algorithm. We show that the computed iso-surface is the boundary of the $r$-offset volume of the target zero level-set $S$, which is an orientable manifold, regardless of the topology of $S$. Next, the algorithm computes a covering map to project the boundary mesh onto $S$, preserving the mesh's topology and avoiding folding. If $S$ is an orientable manifold surface, our algorithm separates the double-layered mesh into a single layer using a robust minimum-cut post-processing step. Otherwise, it keeps the double-layered mesh as the output. We validate our algorithm by reconstructing 3D surfaces of open models and demonstrate its efficacy and effectiveness on synthetic models and benchmark datasets. Our experimental results confirm that our method is robust and produces meshes with better quality in terms of both visual evaluation and quantitative measures than existing UDF-based methods.

| **[Minimum 0-Extension Problems on Directed Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00153v2)** | 2024-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a metric $\mu$ on a finite set $T$, the minimum 0-extension problem 0-Ext$[\mu]$ is defined as follows: Given $V\supseteq T$ and $\ c:{V \choose 2}\rightarrow \mathbf{Q_+}$, minimize $\sum c(xy)\mu(\gamma(x),\gamma(y))$ subject to $\gamma:V\rightarrow T,\ \gamma(t)=t\ (\forall t\in T)$, where the sum is taken over all unordered pairs in $V$. This problem generalizes several classical combinatorial optimization problems such as the minimum cut problem or the multiterminal cut problem. Karzanov and Hirai established a complete classification of metrics $\mu$ for which 0-Ext$[\mu]$ is polynomial time solvable or NP-hard. This result can also be viewed as a sharpening of the general dichotomy theorem for finite-valued CSPs (Thapper and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} 2016) specialized to 0-Ext$[\mu]$. In this paper, we consider a directed version $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$ of the minimum 0-extension problem, where $\mu$ and $c$ are not assumed to be symmetric. We extend the NP-hardness condition of 0-Ext$[\mu]$ to $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$: If $\mu$ cannot be represented as the shortest path metric of an orientable modular graph with an orbit-invariant ``directed'' edge-length, then $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$ is NP-hard. We also show a partial converse: If $\mu$ is a directed metric of a modular lattice with an orbit-invariant directed edge-length, then $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$ is tractable. We further provide a new NP-hardness condition characteristic of $\overrightarrow{0}$-Ext$[\mu]$, and establish a dichotomy for the case where $\mu$ is a directed metric of a star.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multicut Problems in Embedded Graphs: The Dependency of Complexity on the Demand Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11086v1)** | 2023-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Multicut problem asks for a minimum cut separating certain pairs of vertices: formally, given a graph $G$ and demand graph $H$ on a set $T\subseteq V(G)$ of terminals, the task is to find a minimum-weight set $C$ of edges of $G$ such that whenever two vertices of $T$ are adjacent in $H$, they are in different components of $G\setminus C$. Colin de Verdi\`{e}re [Algorithmica, 2017] showed that Multicut with $t$ terminals on a graph $G$ of genus $g$ can be solved in time $f(t,g)n^{O(\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$. Cohen-Addad et al. [JACM, 2021] proved a matching lower bound showing that the exponent of $n$ is essentially best possible (for fixed values of $t$ and $g$), even in the special case of Multiway Cut, where the demand graph $H$ is a complete graph. However, this lower bound tells us nothing about other special cases of Multicut such as Group 3-Terminal Cut. We show that if the demand pattern is, in some sense, close to being a complete bipartite graph, then Multicut can be solved faster than $f(t,g)n^{O(\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$, and furthermore this is the only property that allows such an improvement. Formally, for a class $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$ is the special case where the demand graph $H$ is in $\mathcal{H}$. For every fixed class $\mathcal{H}$ (satisfying some mild closure property), fixed $g$, and fixed $t$, our main result gives tight upper and lower bounds on the exponent of $n$ in algorithms solving Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$. In addition, we investigate a similar setting where, instead of parameterizing by the genus $g$ of $G$, we parameterize by the minimum number $k$ of edges of $G$ that need to be deleted to obtain a planar graph. Interestingly, in this setting it makes a significant difference whether the graph $G$ is weighted or unweighted: further nontrivial algorithmic techniques give substantial improvements in the unweighted case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentially Private Algorithms for Graphs Under Continual Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14756v2)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private algorithms protect individuals in data analysis scenarios by ensuring that there is only a weak correlation between the existence of the user in the data and the result of the analysis. Dynamic graph algorithms maintain the solution to a problem (e.g., a matching) on an evolving input, i.e., a graph where nodes or edges are inserted or deleted over time. They output the value of the solution after each update operation, i.e., continuously. We study (event-level and user-level) differentially private algorithms for graph problems under continual observation, i.e., differentially private dynamic graph algorithms. We present event-level private algorithms for partially dynamic counting-based problems such as triangle count that improve the additive error by a polynomial factor (in the length $T$ of the update sequence) on the state of the art, resulting in the first algorithms with additive error polylogarithmic in $T$. We also give $\varepsilon$-differentially private and partially dynamic algorithms for minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, densest subgraph, and maximum matching. The additive error of our improved MST algorithm is $O(W \log^{3/2}T / \varepsilon)$, where $W$ is the maximum weight of any edge, which, as we show, is tight up to a $(\sqrt{\log T} / \varepsilon)$-factor. For the other problems, we present a partially-dynamic algorithm with multiplicative error $(1+\beta)$ for any constant $\beta > 0$ and additive error $O(W \log(nW) \log(T) / (\varepsilon \beta))$. Finally, we show that the additive error for a broad class of dynamic graph algorithms with user-level privacy must be linear in the value of the output solution's range.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected typos in lower bounds in Table 1.

| **[Cactus Representations in Polylogarithmic Max-flow via Maximal Isolating Mincuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10706v1)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A cactus representation of a graph, introduced by Dinitz et al. in 1976, is an edge sparsifier of $O(n)$ size that exactly captures all global minimum cuts of the graph. It is a central combinatorial object that has been a key ingredient in almost all algorithms for the connectivity augmentation problems and for maintaining minimum cuts under edge insertions (e.g. [NGM97], [CKL+22], [Hen97]). This sparsifier was generalized to Steiner cactus for a vertex set $T$, which can be seen as a vertex sparsifier of $O(|T|)$ size that captures all partitions of $T$ corresponding to a $T$-Steiner minimum cut, and also hypercactus, an analogous concept in hypergraphs. These generalizations further extend the applications of cactus to the Steiner and hypergraph settings. In a long line of work on fast constructions of cactus and its generalizations, a near-linear time construction of cactus was shown by [Karger and Panigrahi 2009]. Unfortunately, their technique based on tree packing inherently does not generalize. The state-of-the-art algorithms for Steiner cactus and hypercactus are still slower than linear time by a factor of $\Omega(|T|)$ [DV94] and $\Omega(n)$ [CX17], respectively. We show how to construct both Steiner cactus and hypercactus using polylogarithmic calls to max flow, which gives the first almost-linear time algorithms of both problems. The constructions immediately imply almost-linear-time connectivity augmentation algorithms in the Steiner and hypergraph settings, as well as speed up the incremental algorithm for maintaining minimum cuts in hypergraphs by a factor of $n$. The key technique behind our result is a novel variant of the influential isolating mincut technique [LP20, AKL+21] which we called maximal isolating mincuts. This technique makes the isolating mincuts to be "more balanced" which, we believe, will likely be useful in future applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SODA 2024</p></details> |

Locality means that the decision we make about each edge only depends on its constant radius neighborhood. We show two applications of the algorithms: one is related to the Aldous-Lyons Conjecture, and the other is about approximating the neighborhood distribution of graphs by bounded-size graphs. The scope of our results can be extended to unimodular random graphs and networks. As a corollary, we generalize the Maximum Flow Minimum Cut Theorem to unimodular random flow networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding coherent node groups in directed graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02993v1)** | 2023-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Summarizing a large graph by grouping the nodes into clusters is a standard technique for studying the given network. Traditionally, the order of the discovered groups does not matter. However, there are applications where, for example, given a directed graph, we would like to find coherent groups while minimizing the backward cross edges. More formally, in this paper, we study a problem where we are given a directed network and are asked to partition the graph into a sequence of coherent groups while attempting to conform to the cross edges. We assume that nodes in the network have features, and we measure the group coherence by comparing these features. Furthermore, we incorporate the cross edges by penalizing the forward cross edges and backward cross edges with different weights. If the weights are set to 0, then the problem is equivalent to clustering. However, if we penalize the backward edges significantly more, then the order of discovered groups matters, and we can view our problem as a generalization of a classic segmentation problem. To solve the algorithm we consider a common iterative approach where we solve the groups given the centroids, and then find the centroids given the groups. We show that - unlike in clustering - the first subproblem is NP-hard. However, we show that if the underlying graph is a tree we can solve the subproblem with dynamic programming. In addition, if the number of groups is 2, we can solve the subproblem with a minimum cut. For the more general case, we propose a heuristic where we optimize each pair of groups separately while keeping the remaining groups intact. We also propose a greedy search where nodes are moved between the groups while optimizing the overall loss. We demonstrate with our experiments that the algorithms are practical and yield interpretable results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Approximations for Relative Survivable Network Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06656v2)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most important and well-studied settings for network design is edge-connectivity requirements. This encompasses uniform demands such as the Minimum $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem as well as nonuniform demands such as the Survivable Network Design problem (SND). In a recent paper by [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] , the authors observed that a weakness of these formulations is that it does not enable one to consider fault-tolerance in graphs that have just a few small cuts. To remedy this, they introduced new variants of these problems under the notion "relative" fault-tolerance. Informally, this requires not that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults (as in the classical setting), but that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults and the two nodes are connected in the underlying graph post-faults. The problem is already highly non-trivial even for the case of a single demand. Due to difficulties introduced by this new notion of fault-tolerance, the results in [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] are quite limited. For the Relative Survivable Network Design problem (RSND), when the demands are not uniform they give a nontrivial result only when there is a single demand with a connectivity requirement of $3$: a non-optimal $27/4$-approximation. We strengthen this result in two significant ways: We give a $2$-approximation for RSND where all requirements are at most $3$, and a $2^{O(k^2)}$-approximation for RSND with a single demand of arbitrary value $k$. To achieve these results, we first use the "cactus representation'' of minimum cuts to give a lossless reduction to normal SND. Second, we extend the techniques of [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] to prove a generalized and more complex version of their structure theorem, which we then use to design a recursive approximation algorithm.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Fault Trees, Decision Trees, And Binary Decision Diagrams: A Systematic Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04448v1)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reliability engineering, we need to understand system dependencies, cause-effect relations, identify critical components, and analyze how they trigger failures. Three prominent graph models commonly used for these purposes are fault trees (FTs), decision trees (DTs), and binary decision diagrams (BDDs). These models are popular because they are easy to interpret, serve as a communication tool between stakeholders of various backgrounds, and support decision-making processes. Moreover, these models help to understand real-world problems by computing reliability metrics, minimum cut sets, logic rules, and displaying dependencies. Nevertheless, it is unclear how these graph models compare. Thus, the goal of this paper is to understand the similarities and differences through a systematic comparison based on their (i) purpose and application, (ii) structural representation, (iii) analysis methods, (iv) construction, and (v) benefits & limitations. Furthermore, we use a running example based on a Container Seal Design to showcase the models in practice. Our results show that, given that FTs, DTs and BDDs have different purposes and application domains, they adopt different structural representations and analysis methodologies that entail a variety of benefits and limitations, the latter can be addressed via conversion methods or extensions. Specific remarks are that BDDs can be considered as a compact representation of binary DTs, since the former allows sub-node sharing, which makes BDDs more efficient at representing logical rules than binary DTs. It is possible to obtain cut sets from BDDs and DTs and construct a FT using the (con/dis)junctive normal form, although this may result in a sub-optimal FT structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming to Yoked Neural Networks to Improve ANN Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02157v3)** | 2023-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing classical artificial neural networks (ANN) are designed as a tree structure to imitate neural networks. In this paper, we argue that the connectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. The nodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e., these neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a major drawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent years to more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), these methods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, we propose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in the same level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate a neural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the information transfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance of the method. Our YNN can imitate neural networks much better compared with the traditional ANN. In this paper, we analyze the existing structural bias of ANN and propose a model YNN to efficiently eliminate such structural bias. In our model, nodes also carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and edges determine the flow of information. We further impose auxiliary sparsity constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned structure to focus on critical connections. Finally, based on the optimized structure, we also design small neural module structure based on the minimum cut technique to reduce the computational burden of the YNN model. This learning process is compatible with the existing networks and different tasks. The obtained quantitative experimental results reflect that the learned connectivity is superior to the traditional NN structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2008.08261 by other authors</p></details> |

The disk graph $G_\mathcal{D}$ for $\mathcal{D}$ is the undirected graph with vertex set $\mathcal{D}$ in which two disks are joined by an edge if and only if they intersect. The directed transmission graph $G^{\rightarrow}_\mathcal{D}$ for $\mathcal{D}$ is the directed graph with vertex set $\mathcal{D}$ in which there is an edge from a disk $D_1 \in \mathcal{D}$ to a disk $D_2 \in \mathcal{D}$ if and only if $D_1$ contains the center of $D_2$. Given $\mathcal{D}$ and two non-intersecting disks $s, t \in \mathcal{D}$, we show that a minimum $s$-$t$ vertex cut in $G_\mathcal{D}$ or in $G^{\rightarrow}_\mathcal{D}$ can be found in $O(n^{3/2}\text{polylog} n)$ expected time. To obtain our result, we combine an algorithm for the maximum flow problem in general graphs with dynamic geometric data structures to manipulate the disks. As an application, we consider the barrier resilience problem in a rectangular domain. In this problem, we have a vertical strip $S$ bounded by two vertical lines, $L_\ell$ and $L_r$, and a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of disks. Let $a$ be a point in $S$ above all disks of $\mathcal{D}$, and let $b$ a point in $S$ below all disks of $\mathcal{D}$. The task is to find a curve from $a$ to $b$ that lies in $S$ and that intersects as few disks of $\mathcal{D}$ as possible.

| **[An Efficient Algorithm for All-Pairs Bounded Edge Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02132v1)** | 2023-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our work concerns algorithms for an unweighted variant of Maximum Flow. In the All-Pairs Connectivity (APC) problem, we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and are tasked with computing the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ (equivalently, the size of a minimum $(s,t)$-cut) in $G$, for all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$. Although over undirected graphs APC can be solved in essentially optimal $n^{2+o(1)}$ time, the true time complexity of APC over directed graphs remains open: this problem can be solved in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time, where $\omega \in [2, 2.373)$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication, but no matching conditional lower bound is known. We study a variant of APC called the $k$-Bounded All Pairs Connectivity ($k$-APC) problem. In this problem, we are given an integer $k$ and graph $G$, and are tasked with reporting the size of a minimum $(s,t)$-cut only for pairs $(s,t)$ of vertices with a minimum cut size less than $k$ (if the minimum $(s,t)$-cut has size at least $k$, we just report it is "large" instead of computing the exact value). We present an algorithm solving $k$-APC in directed graphs in $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time. This runtime is $\tilde O(n^\omega)$ for all $k$ polylogarithmic in $n$, which is essentially optimal under popular conjectures from fine-grained complexity. Previously, this runtime was only known for $k\le 2$ [Georgiadis et al., ICALP 2017]. We also study a variant of $k$-APC, the $k$-Bounded All-Pairs Vertex Connectivity ($k$-APVC) problem, which considers internally vertex-disjoint paths instead of edge-disjoint paths. We present an algorithm solving $k$-APVC in directed graphs in $\tilde{O}(k^2n^\omega)$ time. Previous work solved an easier version of the $k$-APVC problem in $\tilde O((kn)^\omega)$ time [Abboud et al, ICALP 2019].</p></details> |  |
| **[Total Variation Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06218v2)** | 2023-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently proposed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for vertex clustering are trained with an unsupervised minimum cut objective, approximated by a Spectral Clustering (SC) relaxation. However, the SC relaxation is loose and, while it offers a closed-form solution, it also yields overly smooth cluster assignments that poorly separate the vertices. In this paper, we propose a GNN model that computes cluster assignments by optimizing a tighter relaxation of the minimum cut based on graph total variation (GTV). The cluster assignments can be used directly to perform vertex clustering or to implement graph pooling in a graph classification framework. Our model consists of two core components: i) a message-passing layer that minimizes the $\ell_1$ distance in the features of adjacent vertices, which is key to achieving sharp transitions between clusters; ii) an unsupervised loss function that minimizes the GTV of the cluster assignments while ensuring balanced partitions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other GNNs for vertex clustering and graph classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Energy Complexity of Diameter and Minimum Cut Computation in Bounded-Genus Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04071v3)** | 2023-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the energy complexity of distributed graph problems in multi-hop radio networks, where the energy cost of an algorithm is measured by the maximum number of awake rounds of a vertex. Recent works revealed that some problems, such as broadcast, breadth-first search, and maximal matching, can be solved with energy-efficient algorithms that consume only $\text{poly} \log n$ energy. However, there exist some problems, such as computing the diameter of the graph, that require $\Omega(n)$ energy to solve. To improve energy efficiency for these problems, we focus on a special graph class: bounded-genus graphs. We present algorithms for computing the exact diameter, the exact global minimum cut size, and a $(1 \pm\epsilon)$-approximate $s$-$t$ minimum cut size with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ energy for bounded-genus graphs. Our approach is based on a generic framework that divides the vertex set into high-degree and low-degree parts and leverages the structural properties of bounded-genus graphs to control the number of certain connected components in the subgraph induced by the low-degree part.</p></details> | <details><summary>Remov...</summary><p>Removing results that were already moved to arXiv:2007.09816.

| **[Massively Parallel Computation in a Heterogeneous Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14692v1)** | 2023-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massively-parallel graph algorithms have received extensive attention over the past decade, with research focusing on three memory regimes: the superlinear regime, the near-linear regime, and the sublinear regime. The sublinear regime is the most desirable in practice, but conditional hardness results point towards its limitations. In this work we study a \emph{heterogeneous} model, where the memory of the machines varies in size. We focus mostly on the heterogeneous setting created by adding a single near-linear machine to the sublinear MPC regime, and show that even a single large machine suffices to circumvent most of the conditional hardness results for the sublinear regime: for graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we give (a) an MST algorithm that runs in $O(\log\log(m/n))$ rounds; (b) an algorithm that constructs an $O(k)$-spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/k})$ in $O(1)$ rounds; and (c) a maximal-matching algorithm that runs in $O(\sqrt{\log(m/n)}\log\log(m/n))$ rounds. We also observe that the best known near-linear MPC algorithms for several other graph problems which are conjectured to be hard in the sublinear regime (minimum cut, maximal independent set, and vertex coloring) can easily be transformed to work in the heterogeneous MPC model with a single near-linear machine, while retaining their original round complexity in the near-linear regime. If the large machine is allowed to have \emph{superlinear} memory, all of the problems above can be solved in $O(1)$ rounds.</p></details> | Appeared in PODC2022 |
| **[TetCNN: Convolutional Neural Networks on Tetrahedral Meshes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03830v2)** | 2023-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been broadly studied on images, videos, graphs, and triangular meshes. However, it has seldom been studied on tetrahedral meshes. Given the merits of using volumetric meshes in applications like brain image analysis, we introduce a novel interpretable graph CNN framework for the tetrahedral mesh structure. Inspired by ChebyNet, our model exploits the volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) to define filters over commonly used graph Laplacian which lacks the Riemannian metric information of 3D manifolds. For pooling adaptation, we introduce new objective functions for localized minimum cuts in the Graclus algorithm based on the LBO. We employ a piece-wise constant approximation scheme that uses the clustering assignment matrix to estimate the LBO on sampled meshes after each pooling. Finally, adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm for tetrahedral meshes, we use the obtained heatmaps to visualize discovered regions-of-interest as biomarkers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on cortical tetrahedral meshes from patients with Alzheimer's disease, as there is scientific evidence showing the correlation of cortical thickness to neurodegenerative disease progression. Our results show the superiority of our LBO-based convolution layer and adapted pooling over the conventionally used unitary cortical thickness, graph Laplacian, and point cloud representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper to Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI 2023) conference</p></details> |

| **[A Nearly Time-Optimal Distributed Approximation of Minimum Cost $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04994v1)** | 2022-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The minimum-cost $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph ($k$-ECSS) problem is a generalization and strengthening of the well-studied minimum-cost spanning tree (MST) problem. While the round complexity of distributedly computing the latter has been well-understood, the former remains mostly open, especially as soon as $k\geq 3$. In this paper, we present the first distributed algorithm that computes an approximation of $k$-ECSS in sublinear time for general $k$. Concretely, we describe a randomized distributed algorithm that, in $\tilde{O}(k(D+k\sqrt{n}))$ rounds, computes a $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph whose cost is within an $O(\log n\log k)$ factor of optimal. Here, $n$ and $D$ denote the number of vertices and diameter of the graph, respectively. This time complexity is nearly optimal for any $k=poly(\log n)$, almost matching an $\tilde{\Omega}(D+\sqrt{n/k})$ lower bound. Our algorithm is the first to achieve a sublinear round complexity for $k\geq 3$. We note that this case is considerably more challenging than the well-studied and well-understood $k=1$ case -- better known as MST -- and the closely related $k=2$ case. Our algorithm is based on reducing the $k$-ECSS problem to $k$ set cover instances, in which we gradually augment the connectivity of the spanning subgraph. To solve each set cover instance, we combine new structural observations on minimum cuts with graph sketching ideas. One key ingredient in our algorithm is a novel structural lemma that allows us to compress the information about all minimum cuts in a graph into a succinct representation, which is computed in a decentralized fashion. We hope that this succinct representation may find applications in other computational settings or for other problems.</p></details> | SODA 2023 |

| **[Vertex Sparsifiers for Hyperedge Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04115v2)** | 2022-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Chalermsook et al. [SODA'21(arXiv:2007.07862)] introduces a notion of vertex sparsifiers for $c$-edge connectivity, which has found applications in parameterized algorithms for network design and also led to exciting dynamic algorithms for $c$-edge st-connectivity [Jin and Sun FOCS'21(arXiv:2004.07650)]. We study a natural extension called vertex sparsifiers for $c$-hyperedge connectivity and construct a sparsifier whose size matches the state-of-the-art for normal graphs. More specifically, we show that, given a hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ hyperedges with $k$ terminal vertices and a parameter $c$, there exists a hypergraph $H$ containing only $O(kc^{3})$ hyperedges that preserves all minimum cuts (up to value $c$) between all subset of terminals. This matches the best bound of $O(kc^{3})$ edges for normal graphs by [Liu'20(arXiv:2011.15101)]. Moreover, $H$ can be constructed in almost-linear $O(p^{1+o(1)} + n(rc\log n)^{O(rc)}\log m)$ time where $r=\max_{e\in E}|e|$ is the rank of $G$ and $p=\sum_{e\in E}|e|$ is the total size of $G$, or in $\text{poly}(m, n)$ time if we slightly relax the size to $O(kc^{3}\log^{1.5}(kc))$ hyperedges.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ESA 2022</p></details> |
| **[Universally-Optimal Distributed Exact Min-Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14967v2)** | 2022-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a universally-optimal distributed algorithm for the exact weighted min-cut. The algorithm is guaranteed to complete in $\widetilde{O}(D + \sqrt{n})$ rounds on every graph, recovering the recent result of Dory, Efron, Mukhopadhyay, and Nanongkai~[STOC'21], but runs much faster on structured graphs. Specifically, the algorithm completes in $\widetilde{O}(D)$ rounds on (weighted) planar graphs or, more generally, any (weighted) excluded-minor family. We obtain this result by designing an aggregation-based algorithm: each node receives only an aggregate of the messages sent to it. While somewhat restrictive, recent work shows any such black-box algorithm can be simulated on any minor of the communication network. Furthermore, we observe this also allows for the addition of (a small number of) arbitrarily-connected virtual nodes to the network. We leverage these capabilities to design a min-cut algorithm that is significantly simpler compared to prior distributed work. We hope this paper showcases how working within this paradigm yields simple-to-design and ultra-efficient distributed algorithms for global problems. Our main technical contribution is a distributed algorithm that, given any tree $T$, computes the minimum cut that $2$-respects $T$ (i.e., cuts at most $2$ edges of $T$) in universally near-optimal time. Moreover, our algorithm gives a \emph{deterministic} $\widetilde{O}(D)$-round 2-respecting cut solution for excluded-minor families and a \emph{deterministic} $\widetilde{O}(D + \sqrt{n})$-round solution for general graphs, the latter resolving a question of Dory, et al.~[STOC'21]</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, accepted to PODC 2022</p></details> |
| **[QB-II for Evaluating the Reliability of Binary-State Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14950v1)** | 2022-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current real-life applications of various networks such as utility (gas, water, electric, 4G/5G) networks, the Internet of Things, social networks, and supply chains. Reliability is one of the most popular tools for evaluating network performance. The fundamental structure of these networks is a binary state network. Distinctive methods have been proposed to efficiently assess binary-state network reliability. A new algorithm called QB-II (quick binary-addition tree algorithm II) is proposed to improve the efficiency of quick BAT, which is based on BAT and outperforms many algorithms. The proposed QB-II implements the shortest minimum cuts (MCs) to separate the entire BAT into main-BAT and sub-BATs, and the source-target matrix convolution products to connect these subgraphs intelligently to improve the efficiency. Twenty benchmark problems were used to validate the performance of the QB-II.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Min-cut in Poly-logarithmic Max-flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02008v2)** | 2022-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give a deterministic algorithm for finding the minimum (weight) cut of an undirected graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges using $\text{polylog}(n)$ calls to any maximum flow subroutine. Using the current best deterministic maximum flow algorithms, this yields an overall running time of $\tilde O(m \cdot \min(\sqrt{m}, n^{2/3}))$ for weighted graphs, and $m^{4/3+o(1)}$ for unweighted (multi)-graphs. This marks the first improvement for this problem since a running time bound of $\tilde O(mn)$ was established by several papers in the early 1990s. Our global minimum cut algorithm is obtained as a corollary of a minimum Steiner cut algorithm, where a minimum Steiner cut is a minimum (weight) set of edges whose removal disconnects at least one pair of vertices among a designated set of terminal vertices. The running time of our deterministic minimum Steiner cut algorithm matches that of the global minimum cut algorithm stated above. Using randomization, the running time improves to $m^{1+o(1)}$ because of a faster maximum flow subroutine; this improves the best known randomized algorithm for the minimum Steiner cut problem as well. Our main technical contribution is a new tool that we call *isolating cuts*. Given a set of vertices $R$, this entails finding cuts of minimum weight that separate (or isolate) each individual vertex $v\in R$ from the rest of the vertices $R\setminus \{v\}$. Na\"ively, this can be done using $|R|$ maximum flow calls, but we show that just $O(\log |R|)$ suffice for finding isolating cuts for any set of vertices $R$. We call this the *isolating cut lemma*.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version of FOCS 2020 paper</p></details> |
| **[Review of Serial and Parallel Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Computer Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00418v2)** | 2022-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimum cut/maximum flow (min-cut/max-flow) algorithms solve a variety of problems in computer vision and thus significant effort has been put into developing fast min-cut/max-flow algorithms. As a result, it is difficult to choose an ideal algorithm for a given problem. Furthermore, parallel algorithms have not been thoroughly compared. In this paper, we evaluate the state-of-the-art serial and parallel min-cut/max-flow algorithms on the largest set of computer vision problems yet. We focus on generic algorithms, i.e., for unstructured graphs, but also compare with the specialized GridCut implementation. When applicable, GridCut performs best. Otherwise, the two pseudoflow algorithms, Hochbaum pseudoflow and excesses incremental breadth first search, achieves the overall best performance. The most memory efficient implementation tested is the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm. Amongst generic parallel algorithms, we find the bottom-up merging approach by Liu and Sun to be best, but no method is dominant. Of the generic parallel methods, only the parallel preflow push-relabel algorithm is able to efficiently scale with many processors across problem sizes, and no generic parallel method consistently outperforms serial algorithms. Finally, we provide and evaluate strategies for algorithm selection to obtain good expected performance. We make our dataset and implementations publicly available for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication at T-PAMI</p></details> |
| **[A Framework to Design Approximation Algorithms for Finding Diverse Solutions in Combinatorial Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08940v1)** | 2022-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding a \emph{single} best solution is the most common objective in combinatorial optimization problems. However, such a single solution may not be applicable to real-world problems as objective functions and constraints are only "approximately" formulated for original real-world problems. To solve this issue, finding \emph{multiple} solutions is a natural direction, and diversity of solutions is an important concept in this context. Unfortunately, finding diverse solutions is much harder than finding a single solution. To cope with difficulty, we investigate the approximability of finding diverse solutions. As a main result, we propose a framework to design approximation algorithms for finding diverse solutions, which yields several outcomes including constant-factor approximation algorithms for finding diverse matchings in graphs and diverse common bases in two matroids and PTASes for finding diverse minimum cuts and interval schedulings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cut query algorithms with star contraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05674v1)** | 2022-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of determining the edge connectivity of a simple graph with cut queries. We show that (i) there is a bounded-error randomized algorithm that computes edge connectivity with $O(n)$ cut queries, and (ii) there is a bounded-error quantum algorithm that computes edge connectivity with $\~O(\sqrt{n})$ cut queries. We prove these results using a new technique called "star contraction" to randomly contract edges of a graph while preserving non-trivial minimum cuts. In star contraction vertices randomly contract an edge incident on a small set of randomly chosen vertices. In contrast to the related 2-out contraction technique of Ghaffari, Nowicki, and Thorup [SODA'20], star contraction only contracts vertex-disjoint star subgraphs, which allows it to be efficiently implemented via cut queries. The $O(n)$ bound from item (i) was not known even for the simpler problem of connectivity, and improves the $O(n\log^3 n)$ bound by Rubinstein, Schramm, and Weinberg [ITCS'18]. The bound is tight under the reasonable conjecture that the randomized communication complexity of connectivity is $\Omega(n\log n)$, an open question since the seminal work of Babai, Frankl, and Simon [FOCS'86]. The bound also excludes using edge connectivity on simple graphs to prove a superlinear randomized query lower bound for minimizing a symmetric submodular function. Item (ii) gives a nearly-quadratic separation with the randomized complexity and addresses an open question of Lee, Santha, and Zhang [SODA'21]. The algorithm can also be viewed as making $\~O(\sqrt{n})$ matrix-vector multiplication queries to the adjacency matrix. Finally, we demonstrate the use of star contraction outside of the cut query setting by designing a one-pass semi-streaming algorithm for computing edge connectivity in the vertex arrival setting. This contrasts with the edge arrival setting where two passes are required.</p></details> |  |

It generalizes and improves the work bounds of a previous data structure of Geissmann and Gianinazzi and is work efficient with respect to the best sequential algorithm. Secondly, we design a parallel algorithm for approximate minimum cut that improves on previous results by Karger and Motwani.

Some of the most efficient algorithms for finding global minimum cuts are randomized algorithms based on Karger's groundbreaking contraction algorithm. Here, we study whether Karger's algorithm can be successfully generalized to other cut problems. We first prove that a wide class of natural generalizations of Karger's algorithm cannot efficiently solve the $s$-$t$-mincut or the normalized cut problem to optimality. However, we then present a simple new algorithm for seeded segmentation / graph-based semi-supervised learning that is closely based on Karger's original algorithm, showing that for these problems, extensions of Karger's algorithm can be useful. The new algorithm has linear asymptotic runtime and yields a potential that can be interpreted as the posterior probability of a sample belonging to a given seed / class. We clarify its relation to the random walker algorithm / harmonic energy minimization in terms of distributions over spanning forests. On classical problems from seeded image segmentation and graph-based semi-supervised learning on image data, the method performs at least as well as the random walker / harmonic energy minimization / Gaussian processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral at ICCV 2021; added acknowledgements</p></details> |

When applied to time series, confidence intervals are computed for each time point separately. Alternatively, we can compute confidence bands, where we are required to find the smallest area enveloping $k$ time series, where $k$ is a user parameter. Confidence bands can be then used to detect abnormal time series, not just individual observations within the time series. We will show that despite being an NP-hard problem it is possible to find optimal confidence band for some $k$. We do this by considering a different problem: discovering regularized bands, where we minimize the envelope area minus the number of included time series weighted by a parameter $\alpha$. Unlike normal confidence bands we can solve the problem exactly by using a minimum cut. By varying $\alpha$ we can obtain solutions for various $k$. If we have a constraint $k$ for which we cannot find appropriate $\alpha$, we demonstrate a simple algorithm that yields $O(\sqrt{n})$ approximation guarantee by connecting the problem to a minimum $k$-union problem. This connection also implies that we cannot approximate the problem better than $O(n^{1/4})$ under some (mild) assumptions. Finally, we consider a variant where instead of minimizing the area we minimize the maximum width. Here, we demonstrate a simple 2-approximation algorithm and show that we cannot achieve better approximation guarantee.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dynamic Algorithms Against an Adaptive Adversary: Generic Constructions and Lower Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03980v1)** | 2021-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dynamic algorithm against an adaptive adversary is required to be correct when the adversary chooses the next update after seeing the previous outputs of the algorithm. We obtain faster dynamic algorithms against an adaptive adversary and separation results between what is achievable in the oblivious vs. adaptive settings. To get these results we exploit techniques from differential privacy, cryptography, and adaptive data analysis. We give a general reduction transforming a dynamic algorithm against an oblivious adversary to a dynamic algorithm robust against an adaptive adversary. This reduction maintains several copies of the oblivious algorithm and uses differential privacy to protect their random bits. Using this reduction we obtain dynamic algorithms against an adaptive adversary with improved update and query times for global minimum cut, all pairs distances, and all pairs effective resistance. We further improve our update and query times by showing how to maintain a sparsifier over an expander decomposition that can be refreshed fast. This fast refresh enables it to be robust against what we call a blinking adversary that can observe the output of the algorithm only following refreshes. We believe that these techniques will prove useful for additional problems. On the flip side, we specify dynamic problems that, assuming a random oracle, every dynamic algorithm that solves them against an adaptive adversary must be polynomially slower than a rather straightforward dynamic algorithm that solves them against an oblivious adversary. We first show a separation result for a search problem and then show a separation result for an estimation problem. In the latter case our separation result draws from lower bounds in adaptive data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding the KT partition of a weighted graph in near-linear time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01378v1)** | 2021-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a breakthrough work, Kawarabayashi and Thorup (J.~ACM'19) gave a near-linear time deterministic algorithm for minimum cut in a simple graph $G = (V,E)$. A key component is finding the $(1+\varepsilon)$-KT partition of $G$, the coarsest partition $\{P_1, \ldots, P_k\}$ of $V$ such that for every non-trivial $(1+\varepsilon)$-near minimum cut with sides $\{S, \bar{S}\}$ it holds that $P_i$ is contained in either $S$ or $\bar{S}$, for $i=1, \ldots, k$. Here we give a near-linear time randomized algorithm to find the $(1+\varepsilon)$-KT partition of a weighted graph. Our algorithm is quite different from that of Kawarabayashi and Thorup and builds on Karger's framework of tree-respecting cuts (J.~ACM'00). We describe applications of the algorithm. (i) The algorithm makes progress towards a more efficient algorithm for constructing the polygon representation of the set of near-minimum cuts in a graph. This is a generalization of the cactus representation initially described by Bencz\'ur (FOCS'95). (ii) We improve the time complexity of a recent quantum algorithm for minimum cut in a simple graph in the adjacency list model from $\widetilde O(n^{3/2})$ to $\widetilde O(\sqrt{mn})$. (iii) We describe a new type of randomized algorithm for minimum cut in simple graphs with complexity $O(m + n \log^6 n)$. For slightly dense graphs this matches the complexity of the current best $O(m + n \log^2 n)$ algorithm which uses a different approach based on random contractions. The key technical contribution of our work is the following. Given a weighted graph $G$ with $m$ edges and a spanning tree $T$, consider the graph $H$ whose nodes are the edges of $T$, and where there is an edge between two nodes of $H$ iff the corresponding 2-respecting cut of $T$ is a non-trivial near-minimum cut of $G$. We give a $O(m \log^4 n)$ time deterministic algorithm to compute a spanning forest of $H$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Friendly Cut Sparsifiers and Faster Gomory-Hu Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15891v1)** | 2021-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We devise new cut sparsifiers that are related to the classical sparsification of Nagamochi and Ibaraki [Algorithmica, 1992], which is an algorithm that, given an unweighted graph $G$ on $n$ nodes and a parameter $k$, computes a subgraph with $O(nk)$ edges that preserves all cuts of value up to $k$. We put forward the notion of a friendly cut sparsifier, which is a minor of $G$ that preserves all friendly cuts of value up to $k$, where a cut in $G$ is called friendly if every node has more edges connecting it to its own side of the cut than to the other side. We present an algorithm that, given a simple graph $G$, computes in almost-linear time a friendly cut sparsifier with $\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{k})$ edges. Using similar techniques, we also show how, given in addition a terminal set $T$, one can compute in almost-linear time a terminal sparsifier, which preserves the minimum $st$-cut between every pair of terminals, with $\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{k} + |T| k)$ edges. Plugging these sparsifiers into the recent $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithms for constructing a Gomory-Hu tree of simple graphs, along with a relatively simple procedure for handling the unfriendly minimum cuts, we improve the running time for moderately dense graphs (e.g., with $m=n^{1.75}$ edges). In particular, assuming a linear-time Max-Flow algorithm, the new state-of-the-art for Gomory-Hu tree is the minimum between our $(m+n^{1.75})^{1+o(1)}$ and the known $m n^{1/2+o(1)}$. We further investigate the limits of this approach and the possibility of better sparsification. Under the hypothesis that an $\tilde{O}(n)$-edge sparsifier that preserves all friendly minimum $st$-cuts can be computed efficiently, our upper bound improves to $\tilde{O}(m+n^{1.5})$ which is the best possible without breaking the cubic barrier for constructing Gomory-Hu trees in non-simple graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic enumeration of all minimum cut-sets and $k$-cut-sets in hypergraphs for fixed $k$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14815v2)** | 2021-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of deterministically enumerating all minimum $k$-cut-sets in a given hypergraph for any fixed $k$. The input here is a hypergraph $G = (V, E)$ with non-negative hyperedge costs. A subset $F$ of hyperedges is a $k$-cut-set if the number of connected components in $G - F$ is at least $k$ and it is a minimum $k$-cut-set if it has the least cost among all $k$-cut-sets. For fixed $k$, we call the problem of finding a minimum $k$-cut-set as Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and the problem of enumerating all minimum $k$-cut-sets as Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut. The special cases of Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut restricted to graph inputs are well-known to be solvable in (randomized as well as deterministic) polynomial time. In contrast, it is only recently that polynomial-time algorithms for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut were developed. The randomized polynomial-time algorithm for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut that was designed in 2018 (Chandrasekaran, Xu, and Yu, SODA 2018) showed that the number of minimum $k$-cut-sets in a hypergraph is $O(n^{2k-2})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input hypergraph, and that they can all be enumerated in randomized polynomial time, thus resolving Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut in randomized polynomial time. A deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut was subsequently designed in 2020 (Chandrasekaran and Chekuri, FOCS 2020), but it is not guaranteed to enumerate all minimum $k$-cut-sets. In this work, we give the first deterministic polynomial-time algorithm to solve Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut (this is non-trivial even for $k = 2$). Our algorithms are based on new structural results that allow for efficient recovery of all minimum $k$-cut-sets by solving minimum $(S,T)$-terminal cuts. Our techniques give new structural insights even for enumerating all minimum cut-sets (i.e., minimum 2-cut-sets) in a given hypergraph.</p></details> | Accepted to SODA'22 |
| **[The complexity of high-dimensional cuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10195v1)** | 2021-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cut problems form one of the most fundamental classes of problems in algorithmic graph theory. For instance, the minimum cut, the minimum $s$-$t$ cut, the minimum multiway cut, and the minimum $k$-way cut are some of the commonly encountered cut problems. Many of these problems have been extensively studied over several decades. In this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study of some cut problems in high dimensions. The first problem we study, namely, Topological Hitting Set (THS), is defined as follows: Given a nontrivial $r$-cycle $\zeta$ in a simplicial complex $\mathsf{K}$, find a set $\mathcal{S}$ of $r$-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that $\mathcal{S}$ meets every cycle homologous to $\zeta$. Our main result is that this problem admits a polynomial-time solution on triangulations of closed surfaces. Interestingly, the optimal solution is given in terms of the cocycles of the surface. For general complexes, we show that THS is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size $k$. On the positive side, we show that THS admits an FPT algorithm with respect to $k+d$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the Hasse graph of the complex $\mathsf{K}$. We also define a problem called Boundary Nontrivialization (BNT): Given a bounding $r$-cycle $\zeta$ in a simplicial complex $\mathsf{K}$, find a set $\mathcal{S}$ of $(r+1)$-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that the removal of $\mathcal{S}$ from $\mathsf{K}$ makes $\zeta$ non-bounding. We show that BNT is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size as the parameter, and has an $O(\log n)$-approximation FPT algorithm for $(r+1)$-dimensional complexes with the $(r+1)$-th Betti number $\beta_{r+1}$ as the parameter. Finally, we provide randomized (approximation) FPT algorithms for the global variants of THS and BNT.</p></details> |  |

There is a multitude of cut or partitioning problems that have been the focus of research for multiple decades.

By viewing flows and cuts topologically in terms of the simplicial (co)boundary operator we can state these problems as linear programs and show that they are dual to one another. Unlike graphs, complexes with integral capacity constraints may have fractional max-flows. We show that computing a maximum integral flow is NP-hard. Moreover, we give a combinatorial definition of a simplicial cut that seems more natural in the context of optimization problems and show that computing such a cut is NP-hard. However, we provide conditions on the simplicial complex for when the cut found by the linear program is a combinatorial cut. For $d$-dimensional simplicial complexes embedded into $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ we provide algorithms operating on the dual graph: computing a maximum flow is dual to computing a shortest path and computing a minimum cut is dual to computing a minimum cost circulation. Finally, we investigate the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on simplicial complexes, prove its correctness, and provide a heuristic which guarantees it to halt.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA) 2021</p></details> |
| **[Low-Congestion Shortcuts in Constant Diameter Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01894v2)** | 2021-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low congestion shortcuts, introduced by Ghaffari and Haeupler (SODA 2016), provide a unified framework for global optimization problems in the congest model of distributed computing. Roughly speaking, for a given graph $G$ and a collection of vertex-disjoint connected subsets $S_1,\ldots, S_\ell \subseteq V(G)$, $(c,d)$ low-congestion shortcuts augment each subgraph $G[S_i]$ with a subgraph $H_i \subseteq G$ such that: (i) each edge appears on at most $c$ subgraphs (congestion bound), and (ii) the diameter of each subgraph $G[S_i] \cup H_i$ is bounded by $d$ (dilation bound). It is desirable to compute shortcuts of small congestion and dilation as these quantities capture the round complexity of many global optimization problems in the congest model. For $n$-vertex graphs with constant diameter $D=O(1)$, Elkin (STOC 2004) presented an (implicit) shortcuts lower bound with $c+d=\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{(D-2)/(2D-2)})$. A nearly matching upper bound, however, was only recently obtained for $D \in \{3,4\}$ by Kitamura et al. (DISC 2019). In this work, we resolve the long-standing complexity gap of shortcuts in constant diameter graphs, originally posed by Lotker et al. (PODC 2001). We present new shortcut constructions which match, up to poly-logarithmic terms, the lower bounds of Das-Sarma et al. As a result, we provide improved and existentially optimal algorithms for several network optimization tasks in constant diameter graphs, including MST, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum cuts and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in PODC 2021</p></details> |
| **[Quantum complexity of minimum cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09823v3)** | 2021-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The minimum cut problem in an undirected and weighted graph $G$ is to find the minimum total weight of a set of edges whose removal disconnects $G$. We completely characterize the quantum query and time complexity of the minimum cut problem in the adjacency matrix model. If $G$ has $n$ vertices and edge weights at least $1$ and at most $\tau$, we give a quantum algorithm to solve the minimum cut problem using $\tilde O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\tau})$ queries and time. Moreover, for every integer $1 \le \tau \le n$ we give an example of a graph $G$ with edge weights $1$ and $\tau$ such that solving the minimum cut problem on $G$ requires $\Omega(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\tau})$ many queries to the adjacency matrix of $G$. These results contrast with the classical randomized case where $\Omega(n^2)$ queries to the adjacency matrix are needed in the worst case even to decide if an unweighted graph is connected or not. In the adjacency array model, when $G$ has $m$ edges the classical randomized complexity of the minimum cut problem is $\tilde \Theta(m)$. We show that the quantum query and time complexity are $\tilde O(\sqrt{mn\tau})$ and $\tilde O(\sqrt{mn\tau} + n^{3/2})$, respectively, where again the edge weights are between $1$ and $\tau$. For dense graphs we give lower bounds on the quantum query complexity of $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ for $\tau > 1$ and $\Omega(\tau n)$ for any $1 \leq \tau \leq n$. Our query algorithm uses a quantum algorithm for graph sparsification by Apers and de Wolf (FOCS 2020) and results on the structure of near-minimum cuts by Kawarabayashi and Thorup (STOC 2015) and Rubinstein, Schramm and Weinberg (ITCS 2018). Our time efficient implementation builds on Karger's tree packing technique (STOC 1996).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages; v2: improved bounds on query and time complexity; v3: fixes typos, accepted to CCC 2021</p></details> |

The capacity of each edge is encoded as an upper bound on the number of state variables that can be communicated instantaneously. When the edge capacities are small compared to the dimensionality of the state vectors, it is not possible to instantaneously communicate full state information over every edge. We investigate how robust consensus (small steady state variance of the states) can be achieved within a linear time-invariant setting by optimally assigning edges to state-dimensions. We show that if a finite steady state variance of the states can be achieved, then both the minimum cut capacity and the total capacity of the network should be sufficiently large. Optimal and approximate solutions are provided for some special classes of graphs. We also consider the related problem of optimally allocating additional capacity on a feasible initial solution. We show that this problem corresponds to the maximization of a submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, which can be approximated via a greedy algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS) and American Control Conference 2021.

| **[Uncertainty in Minimum Cost Multicuts for Image and Motion Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07469v1)** | 2021-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The minimum cost lifted multicut approach has proven practically good performance in a wide range of applications such as image decomposition, mesh segmentation, multiple object tracking, and motion segmentation. It addresses such problems in a graph-based model, where real-valued costs are assigned to the edges between entities such that the minimum cut decomposes the graph into an optimal number of segments. Driven by a probabilistic formulation of minimum cost multicuts, we provide a measure for the uncertainties of the decisions made during the optimization. We argue that access to such uncertainties is crucial for many practical applications and conduct an evaluation by means of sparsifications on three different, widely used datasets in the context of image decomposition (BSDS-500) and motion segmentation (DAVIS2016 and FBMS59) in terms of variation of information (VI) and Rand index (RI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 37th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2021)</p></details> |

| **[Isolating Cuts, (Bi-)Submodularity, and Faster Algorithms for Global Connectivity Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12908v1)** | 2021-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Li and Panigrahi, in recent work, obtained the first deterministic algorithm for the global minimum cut of a weighted undirected graph that runs in time $o(mn)$. They introduced an elegant and powerful technique to find isolating cuts for a terminal set in a graph via a small number of $s$-$t$ minimum cut computations. In this paper we generalize their isolating cut approach to the abstract setting of symmetric bisubmodular functions (which also capture symmetric submodular functions). Our generalization to bisubmodularity is motivated by applications to element connectivity and vertex connectivity. Utilizing the general framework and other ideas we obtain significantly faster randomized algorithms for computing global (and subset) connectivity in a number of settings including hypergraphs, element connectivity and vertex connectivity in graphs, and for symmetric submodular functions.</p></details> |  |

Recently, computational methods were introduced for computing the effective crack energy of periodic and random media. These were based on the continuous minimum cut-maximum flow duality of G. Strang, and made use of discretizations based on trigonometric polynomials and finite elements. For maximum flow problems on graphs, node-based discretization methods avoid metrication artifacts associated to edge-based discretizations. We discretize the minimum cut problem on heterogeneous microstructures by the combinatorial continuous maximum flow discretization introduced by Couprie et al. Furthermore, we introduce an associated FFT-based ADMM solver and provide several adaptive strategies for choosing numerical parameters. We demonstrate the salient features of the proposed approach on problems of industrial scale.</p></details> |  |

This improves the previous best work by Geissmann and Gianinazzi [SPAA 2018] by $O(\log^3 n)$ factor, while matching the depth of their algorithm. To do this, we design a work-efficient approximation algorithm and parallelize the recent sequential algorithms [MN STOC 2020; GMW SOSA 2021] that exploit a connection between 2-respecting minimum cuts and 2-dimensional orthogonal range searching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates on this version: Minor corrections for the previous and our result</p></details> |
| **[Weighted Min-Cut: Sequential, Cut-Query and Streaming Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01651v5)** | 2021-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the following 2-respecting min-cut problem. Given a weighted graph $G$ and its spanning tree $T$, find the minimum cut among the cuts that contain at most two edges in $T$. This problem is an important subroutine in Karger's celebrated randomized near-linear-time min-cut algorithm [STOC'96]. We present a new approach for this problem which can be easily implemented in many settings, leading to the following randomized min-cut algorithms for weighted graphs. * An $O(m\frac{\log^2 n}{\log\log n} + n\log^6 n)$-time sequential algorithm: This improves Karger's $O(m \log^3 n)$ and $O(m\frac{(\log^2 n)\log (n^2/m)}{\log\log n} + n\log^6 n)$ bounds when the input graph is not extremely sparse or dense. Improvements over Karger's bounds were previously known only under a rather strong assumption that the input graph is simple [Henzinger et al. SODA'17; Ghaffari et al. SODA'20]. For unweighted graphs with parallel edges, our bound can be improved to $O(m\frac{\log^{1.5} n}{\log\log n} + n\log^6 n)$. * An algorithm requiring $\tilde O(n)$ cut queries to compute the min-cut of a weighted graph: This answers an open problem by Rubinstein et al. ITCS'18, who obtained a similar bound for simple graphs. * A streaming algorithm that requires $\tilde O(n)$ space and $O(\log n)$ passes to compute the min-cut: The only previous non-trivial exact min-cut algorithm in this setting is the 2-pass $\tilde O(n)$-space algorithm on simple graphs [Rubinstein et al., ITCS'18] (observed by Assadi et al. STOC'19). In contrast to Karger's 2-respecting min-cut algorithm which deploys sophisticated dynamic programming techniques, our approach exploits some cute structural properties so that it only needs to compute the values of $\tilde O(n)$ cuts corresponding to removing $\tilde O(n)$ pairs of tree edges, an operation that can be done quickly in many settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates on this version: (1) Minor corrections in Section 5.1, 5.2; (2) Reference to newer results by GMW SOSA21 (arXiv:2008.02060v2), DEMN STOC21 (arXiv:2004.09129v2) and LMN 21 (arXiv:2102.06565v1)</p></details> |

| **[Detecting Bots and Assessing Their Impact in Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12398v5)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online social networks are often subject to influence campaigns by malicious actors through the use of automated accounts known as bots. We consider the problem of detecting bots in online social networks and assessing their impact on the opinions of individuals. We begin by analyzing the behavior of bots in social networks and identify that they exhibit heterophily, meaning they interact with humans more than other bots. We use this property to develop a detection algorithm based on the Ising model from statistical physics. The bots are identified by solving a minimum cut problem. We show that this Ising model algorithm can identify bots with higher accuracy while utilizing much less data than other state of the art methods. We then develop a a function we call generalized harmonic influence centrality to estimate the impact bots have on the opinions of users in social networks. This function is based on a generalized opinion dynamics model and captures how the activity level and network connectivity of the bots shift equilibrium opinions. To apply generalized harmonic influence centrality to real social networks, we develop a deep neural network to measure the opinions of users based on their social network posts. Using this neural network, we then calculate the generalized harmonic influence centrality of bots in multiple real social networks. For some networks we find that a limited number of bots can cause non-trivial shifts in the population opinions. In other networks, we find that the bots have little impact. Overall we find that generalized harmonic influence centrality is a useful operational tool to measure the impact of bots in social networks.</p></details> | 58 pages, 11 figures |
| **[On the cut dimension of a graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05085v2)** | 2020-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $G = (V,w)$ be a weighted undirected graph with $m$ edges. The cut dimension of $G$ is the dimension of the span of the characteristic vectors of the minimum cuts of $G$, viewed as vectors in $\{0,1\}^m$. For every $n \ge 2$ we show that the cut dimension of an $n$-vertex graph is at most $2n-3$, and construct graphs realizing this bound. The cut dimension was recently defined by Graur et al.\ \cite{GPRW20}, who show that the maximum cut dimension of an $n$-vertex graph is a lower bound on the number of cut queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to solve the minimum cut problem on $n$-vertex graphs. For every $n\ge 2$, Graur et al.\ exhibit a graph on $n$ vertices with cut dimension at least $3n/2 -2$, giving the first lower bound larger than $n$ on the deterministic cut query complexity of computing mincut. We observe that the cut dimension is even a lower bound on the number of \emph{linear} queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to solve mincut, where a linear query can ask any vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^{\binom{n}{2}}$ and receives the answer $w^T x$. Our results thus show a lower bound of $2n-3$ on the number of linear queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to solve minimum cut on $n$-vertex graphs, and imply that one cannot show a lower bound larger than this via the cut dimension. We further introduce a generalization of the cut dimension which we call the $\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension. The $\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension is also a lower bound on the number of linear queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to compute minimum cut. It is always at least as large as the cut dimension, and we construct an infinite family of graphs on $n=3k+1$ vertices with $\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension $2n-2$, showing that it can be strictly larger than the cut dimension.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 figures.

While the min-cut can be computed efficiently in the sequential setting [Karger STOC'96], there was no efficient way for a distributed network to compute its own min-cut without limiting the input structure or dropping the output quality: In the standard CONGEST model, existing algorithms with nearly-optimal time (e.g. [Ghaffari, Kuhn, DISC'13; Nanongkai, Su, DISC'14]) can guarantee a solution that is $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation at best while the exact $\tilde O(n^{0.8}D^{0.2} + n^{0.9})$-time algorithm [Ghaffari, Nowicki, Thorup, SODA'20] works only on *simple* networks (no weights and no parallel edges). Here $n$ and $D$ denote the network's number of vertices and hop-diameter, respectively. For the weighted case, the best bound was $\tilde O(n)$ [Daga, Henzinger, Nanongkai, Saranurak, STOC'19]. In this paper, we provide an *exact* $\tilde O(\sqrt n + D)$-time algorithm for computing min-cut on *weighted* networks. Our result improves even the previous algorithm that works only on simple networks. Its time complexity matches the known lower bound up to polylogarithmic factors. At the heart of our algorithm are a clever routing trick and two structural lemmas regarding the structure of a minimum cut of a graph. These two structural lemmas considerably strengthen and generalize the framework of Mukhopadhyay-Nanongkai [STOC'20] and can be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major changes: (i) The fragment decomposition technique is simplified, (ii) Introduction and technical overview have been redone, and (iii) The technical sections have been made simpler for better readability</p></details> |
| **[Parametric Graph Templates: Properties and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07001v1)** | 2020-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical structure and repetition are prevalent in graphs originating from nature or engineering. These patterns can be represented by a class of parametric-structure graphs, which are defined by templates that generate structure by way of repeated instantiation. We propose a class of parametric graph templates that can succinctly represent a wide variety of graphs. Using parametric graph templates, we develop structurally-parametric algorithm variants of maximum flow, minimum cut, and tree subgraph isomorphism. Our algorithms are polynomial time for maximum flow and minimum cut and are fixed-parameter tractable for tree subgraph isomorphism when parameterized by the size of the tree subgraph. By reasoning about the structure of the repeating subgraphs, we avoid explicit construction of the instantiation. Furthermore, we show how parametric graph templates can be recovered from an instantiated graph in quasi-polynomial time when certain parameters of the graph are bounded. Parametric graph templates and the presented algorithmic techniques thus create opportunities for reasoning about the generating structure of a graph, rather than an instance of it.</p></details> |  |

Our revisit is occasioned by a paper of Fox, Panigrahi, and Zhang which gives an extension of the Karger-Stein algorithm to minimum cuts and minimum $k$-cuts in hypergraphs. When specialized to the case of graphs, the algorithm is somewhat different than the original Karger-Stein algorithm. We show that the analysis becomes particularly clean in this case: we can prove that the probability that a fixed minimum cut in an $n$ node graph is returned by the algorithm is bounded below by $1/(2H_n-2)$, where $H_n$ is the $n$th harmonic number. We also consider other similar variants of the algorithm, and show that no such algorithm can achieve an asymptotically better probability of finding a fixed minimum cut.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms 2021 (SOSA 2021)</p></details> |

At its core, our algorithm augments Dinitz's algorithm with a balanced bidirectional search. Our experiments on a scale-free random network model indicate sublinear run time. On scale-free real-world networks, we outperform the commonly used highest-label Push-Relabel implementation by up to two orders of magnitude. Compared to Dinitz's original algorithm, our modifications reduce the search space, e.g., by a factor of 275 on an autonomous systems graph. Beyond these good run times, our algorithm has an additional advantage compared to Push-Relabel. The latter computes a preflow, which makes the extraction of a minimum cut potentially more difficult. This is relevant, for example, for the computation of Gomory-Hu trees. On a social network with 70000 nodes, our algorithm computes the Gomory-Hu tree in 3 seconds compared to 12 minutes when using Push-Relabel.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query Complexity of Global Minimum Cut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09202v2)** | 2020-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we resolve the query complexity of global minimum cut problem for a graph by designing a randomized algorithm for approximating the size of minimum cut in a graph, where the graph can be accessed through local queries like {\sc Degree}, {\sc Neighbor}, and {\sc Adjacency} queries. Given $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, the algorithm with high probability outputs an estimate $\hat{t}$ satisfying the following $(1-\epsilon) t \leq \hat{t} \leq (1+\epsilon) t$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $t$ is the size of minimum cut in the graph. The expected number of local queries used by our algorithm is $\min\left\{m+n,\frac{m}{t}\right\}\mbox{poly}\left(\log n,\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Eden and Rosenbaum showed that $\Omega(m/t)$ many local queries are required for approximating the size of minimum cut in graphs. These two results together resolve the query complexity of the problem of estimating the size of minimum cut in graphs using local queries. Building on the lower bound of Eden and Rosenbaum, we show that, for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to decide if the size of the minimum cut in the graph is $t$ or $t-2$. Also, we show that, for any $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to find all the minimum cut edges even if it is promised that the input graph has a minimum cut of size $t$. Both of our lower bound results are randomized, and hold even if we can make {\sc Random Edge} query apart from local queries.</p></details> | 15 pages |
